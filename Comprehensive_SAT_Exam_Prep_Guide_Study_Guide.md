## PART I: LINEAR FUNCTIONS

### 1.1 Definition and Fundamental Properties

A **linear function** is a relationship between an independent variable $x$ and a dependent variable $y$ such that for every constant change in $x$, there exists a corresponding constant change in $y$. This constant ratio of change is what defines linearity.

**The slope** of a line is the ratio of the constant change in $y$ to the constant change in $x$. Given two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ on a line:

$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \text{rise over run}$$

The slope $m$ represents the rate of change: for every 1 unit increase in $x$, the value of $y$ increases by $m$ units. A positive slope indicates an upward trend (increasing function), while a negative slope indicates a downward trend (decreasing function). A slope of zero corresponds to a horizontal line, and an undefined slope corresponds to a vertical line.

**Key Properties of Linear Functions:**
- The graph is always a straight line.
- The domain and range are all real functions (unless restricted).
- Every linear function (except vertical lines) has exactly one $x$-intercept and one $y$-intercept.
- The function is one-to-one (passes the horizontal line test).

### 1.2 The Three Forms of a Linear Equation

#### Form 1: Slope-Intercept Form — $y = mx + b$

This is the most commonly used form and is **best for graphing and analyzing a line**.

- $m$ = slope of the line
- $b$ = $y$-intercept (the point $(0, b)$ where the line crosses the $y$-axis)

**How to graph using slope-intercept form:**
1. Plot the $y$-intercept $(0, b)$ on the coordinate plane.
2. From that point, use the slope $m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$ to find a second point.
3. Draw a straight line through both points.

**Example:** Graph $y = \frac{2}{3}x - 4$
- $y$-intercept: $(0, -4)$
- Slope: $\frac{2}{3}$ → from $(0,-4)$, go up 2 and right 3 to reach $(3, -2)$
- Draw the line through $(0,-4)$ and $(3,-2)$

---

#### Form 2: Point-Slope Form — $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

This form is **best for modeling** when you know the slope and any single point (not necessarily the $y$-intercept).

- $m$ = slope
- $(x_1, y_1)$ = any known point on the line

**Derivation:** Starting from the slope formula $m = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}$, cross-multiplying gives $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$.

**Example:** Find the equation of the line with slope $-2$ passing through $(5, 3)$.
$$y - 3 = -2(x - 5)$$
$$y - 3 = -2x + 10$$
$$y = -2x + 13$$

---

#### Form 3: Standard Form — $Ax + By = C$

This form is **best for word problems and standardized testing**, and it can represent ALL lines (including vertical lines, which the other forms cannot).

- $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integers (by convention, $A$ should be positive)
- $A$ and $B$ are not both zero

**Converting to slope-intercept form to find slope:**
$$By = -Ax + C$$
$$y = -\frac{A}{B}x + \frac{C}{B}$$

Therefore, the slope is $-\frac{A}{B}$ and the $y$-intercept is $\frac{C}{B}$.

**Intercepts from Standard Form:**
- $x$-intercept: Set $y = 0$, solve for $x$: $x = \frac{C}{A}$, giving point $\left(\frac{C}{A}, 0\right)$
- $y$-intercept: Set $x = 0$, solve for $y$: $y = \frac{C}{B}$, giving point $\left(0, \frac{C}{B}\right)$

---

### 1.3 Converting Between Forms

**Point-Slope → Standard Form:**
Multiply through by the LCD if the slope is a fraction, then rearrange to get $Ax + By = C$.

**Example:** Convert $y - 4 = \frac{3}{5}(x + 2)$ to standard form.
$$y - 4 = \frac{3}{5}x + \frac{6}{5}$$
Multiply everything by 5:
$$5y - 20 = 3x + 6$$
$$-3x + 5y = 26$$
$$3x - 5y = -26$$

**Standard Form → Slope-Intercept Form:**
Isolate $y$:

**Example:** Convert $4x + 7y = -12$ to slope-intercept form.
$$7y = -4x - 12$$
$$y = -\frac{4}{7}x - \frac{12}{7}$$

---

### 1.4 Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

| Relationship | Condition on Slopes |
|---|---|
| **Parallel lines** | $m_1 = m_2$ (same slope, different $y$-intercepts) |
| **Perpendicular lines** | $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$ (negative reciprocal slopes) |

**Negative Reciprocal:** If $m = \frac{a}{b}$, then the perpendicular slope is $-\frac{b}{a}$.

**Example:** Find the slope of a line:
- **Parallel** to $3x - 6y = 12$: First convert to $y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2$, so $m = \frac{1}{2}$. Parallel slope = $\frac{1}{2}$.
- **Perpendicular** to the same line: Perpendicular slope = $-2$.

**SAT/ACT Trap:** A system of two linear equations has **no solution** when the lines are parallel ($m_1 = m_2$ but different $y$-intercepts). It has **infinitely many solutions** when the lines are identical (same slope AND same $y$-intercept). It has **exactly one solution** when the slopes are different.

---

### 1.5 Interpreting Linear Models in Context

When a linear equation models a real-world scenario, each part of the equation has meaning:

For $y = mx + b$:
- **$b$ (the $y$-intercept):** The starting value — the value of $y$ when $x = 0$. This is the initial amount, fixed cost, or baseline.
- **$m$ (the slope):** The rate of change — how much $y$ changes for each 1-unit increase in $x$. This is the per-unit cost, rate of growth, or speed.
- **$x$:** The independent variable (input) — often represents time, quantity, etc.
- **$y$:** The dependent variable (output) — the quantity being modeled.

**Example Interpretation:**
The number of phones remaining in a store after $h$ hours is modeled by $P = 200 - 18h$.
- $200$: The store started with 200 phones (initial stock at $h = 0$)
- $-18$: The store sells 18 phones per hour (rate of decrease)
- When $P = 0$: $0 = 200 - 18h \Rightarrow h = \frac{200}{18} \approx 11.1$ hours to sell out

---

### 1.6 Linear Functions Practice Problems

**Problem 1:** A line passes through $(3, 7)$ and $(-1, -5)$. Find the equation in slope-intercept form.

**Solution:**
$$m = \frac{-5 - 7}{-1 - 3} = \frac{-12}{-4} = 3$$
Using point-slope with $(3, 7)$:
$$y - 7 = 3(x - 3)$$
$$y = 3x - 9 + 7$$
$$\boxed{y = 3x - 2}$$

**Problem 2:** For what value of $c$ does the system $\begin{cases} 3x - cy = 2 \\ 4x + y = 12 \end{cases}$ have no solution?

**Solution:** For no solution, the lines must be parallel (same slope, different intercepts).

Line 1: $y = \frac{3}{c}x - \frac{2}{c}$, slope $= \frac{3}{c}$
Line 2: $y = -4x + 12$, slope $= -4$

Set slopes equal: $\frac{3}{c} = -4 \Rightarrow c = -\frac{3}{4}$

Check: Line 1 becomes $3x + \frac{3}{4}y = 2$, or $12x + 3y = 8$. Divide by 3: $4x + y = \frac{8}{3}$. Line 2 is $4x + y = 12$. Same slope, different intercepts ✓

$$\boxed{c = -\frac{3}{4}}$$

**Problem 3:** The equation $r = \frac{3}{5}f + 8$ models the number of rabbits $r$ in a forest as a function of the number of foxes $f$. If there are 40 rabbits, how many foxes are in the forest?

**Solution:**
$$40 = \frac{3}{5}f + 8$$
$$32 = \frac{3}{5}f$$
$$f = \frac{32 \times 5}{3} = \frac{160}{3} \approx 53.3$$

Since the number of foxes must be a whole number, we interpret this as: at 53 foxes, there would be approximately 40 rabbits. If the problem asks for an exact answer:

$$\boxed{f = \frac{160}{3}}$$

---

## PART II: QUADRATIC FUNCTIONS AND EQUATIONS

### 2.1 Definition and Fundamental Properties

A **quadratic function** is a relationship between $y$ and $x$ where $y$ depends on the square of $x$ (i.e., the highest power of $x$ is 2). All quadratics produce a curve called a **parabola** when graphed.

**General behavior:**
- If $a > 0$: The parabola opens **upward** (U-shape), and the vertex is a **minimum** point.
- If $a < 0$: The parabola opens **downward** (∩-shape), and the vertex is a **maximum** point.
- All parabolas have an **axis of symmetry** — a vertical line through the vertex that divides the parabola into two mirror-image halves.

**Scaling property:** If the quadratic passes through the origin, then $y \sim x^2$. This means if $x$ is doubled, $y$ is quadrupled; if $x$ is tripled, $y$ is scaled by a factor of 9; if $x$ is multiplied by $\sqrt{2}$, $y$ is scaled by a factor of 2.

---

### 2.2 The Three Forms of a Quadratic Equation

#### Form 1: Standard Form — $y = ax^2 + bx + c$

- $a$ = coefficient of $x^2$ (determines direction and width of parabola)
- $b$ = coefficient of $x$
- $c$ = constant term = **$y$-intercept** (the point $(0, c)$)

**Finding the vertex from standard form:**
$$x\text{-coordinate of vertex} = -\frac{b}{2a}$$
$$y\text{-coordinate of vertex} = f\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)$$

**Axis of symmetry:** $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$

**Example:** For $y = 2x^2 - 12x + 7$:
- Vertex $x$-coordinate: $x = -\frac{-12}{2(2)} = \frac{12}{4} = 3$
- Vertex $y$-coordinate: $y = 2(9) - 12(3) + 7 = 18 - 36 + 7 = -11$
- Vertex: $(3, -11)$
- Axis of symmetry: $x = 3$

---

#### Form 2: Vertex Form — $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$

This form **directly reveals the vertex** $(h, k)$.

- $(h, k)$ = vertex of the parabola
- $a$ = same as in standard form (direction and width)
- Axis of symmetry: $x = h$

**Finding roots using the Square Root Method:**
$$a(x - h)^2 + k = 0$$
$$(x - h)^2 = -\frac{k}{a}$$
$$x - h = \pm\sqrt{-\frac{k}{a}}$$
$$x = h \pm \sqrt{-\frac{k}{a}}$$

**Note:** This only works when the right-hand side is non-negative. If $-\frac{k}{a} < 0$, there are no real roots.

**Example:** Find the roots of $y = 2(x - 7)^2 - 30$.
$$2(x-7)^2 - 30 = 0$$
$$(x-7)^2 = 15$$
$$x - 7 = \pm\sqrt{15}$$
$$\boxed{x = 7 \pm \sqrt{15}}$$

---

#### Form 3: Intercept (Factored) Form — $y = a(x - p)(x - q)$

This form **directly reveals the $x$-intercepts** (roots).

- $p$ and $q$ are the roots (x-intercepts): $(p, 0)$ and $(q, 0)$
- $a$ = same as in standard form

**Finding the vertex from intercept form:**
The axis of symmetry lies halfway between the roots:
$$x = \frac{p + q}{2}$$
Then substitute back to find the $y$-coordinate.

**Example:** For $y = 3(x - 2)(x - 8)$:
- Roots: $x = 2$ and $x = 8$
- Vertex $x$-coordinate: $x = \frac{2 + 8}{2} = 5$
- Vertex $y$-coordinate: $y = 3(5-2)(5-8) = 3(3)(-3) = -27$
- Vertex: $(5, -27)$

---

### 2.3 The Quadratic Formula

For any quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are:

$$\boxed{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}$$

**Derivation by Completing the Square:**

Starting with $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:

1. Divide by $a$: $x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = 0$
2. Move constant: $x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a}$
3. Complete the square: $x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{b^2}{4a^2} = \frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{c}{a}$
4. Factor: $\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}$
5. Square root: $x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
6. Solve: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

---

### 2.4 The Discriminant — $D = b^2 - 4ac$

The discriminant tells us the **number and type of solutions** without solving the equation:

| Discriminant Value | Number of Real Roots | Nature of Roots |
|---|---|---|
| $D > 0$ | 2 distinct real roots | If $D$ is a perfect square: rational roots. If not: irrational roots. |
| $D = 0$ | 1 real root (repeated) | The vertex lies on the $x$-axis. |
| $D < 0$ | 0 real roots | The parabola does not cross the $x$-axis. |

**Example:** Determine the nature of roots for $4x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0$.
$$D = (-12)^2 - 4(4)(9) = 144 - 144 = 0$$
One repeated real root. The vertex is on the $x$-axis.

---

### 2.5 Sum and Product of Roots

For $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with roots $r_1$ and $r_2$:

$$\text{Sum of roots: } r_1 + r_2 = -\frac{b}{a}$$
$$\text{Product of roots: } r_1 \cdot r_2 = \frac{c}{a}$$

**Application:** If the sum of the roots is 8, then the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is:
$$x = \frac{r_1 + r_2}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4$$

This is consistent with $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = \frac{\text{sum of roots}}{2}$.

---

### 2.6 Completing the Square — Converting Standard to Vertex Form

**Procedure for $y = ax^2 + bx + c$:**

1. Factor $a$ from the first two terms: $y = a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x\right) + c$
2. Take half of $\frac{b}{a}$, square it: $\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2}{4a^2}$
3. Add and subtract this inside the parentheses
4. Factor the perfect square trinomial
5. Simplify

**Example:** Convert $y = 3x^2 + 12x + 1$ to vertex form.

$$y = 3(x^2 + 4x) + 1$$
$$y = 3(x^2 + 4x + 4 - 4) + 1$$
$$y = 3(x + 2)^2 - 12 + 1$$
$$\boxed{y = 3(x + 2)^2 - 11}$$

Vertex: $(-2, -11)$

---

### 2.7 Converting Intercept Form to Standard Form (FOIL)

To convert $y = a(x - p)(x - q)$ to standard form:

1. **F**irst: $x \cdot x = x^2$
2. **O**uter: $x \cdot (-q) = -qx$
3. **I**nner: $(-p) \cdot x = -px$
4. **L**ast: $(-p) \cdot (-q) = pq$

$$y = a(x^2 - qx - px + pq) = a(x^2 - (p+q)x + pq)$$

**Example:** Convert $y = 2(x - 1)(x + 5)$ to standard form.
$$y = 2(x^2 + 5x - x - 5)$$
$$y = 2(x^2 + 4x - 5)$$
$$\boxed{y = 2x^2 + 8x - 10}$$

---

### 2.8 Quadratic Practice Problems

**Problem 1:** Find the vertex of $y = -3x^2 + 18x - 14$ and determine whether it is a maximum or minimum.

**Solution:**
$$x = -\frac{18}{2(-3)} = \frac{-18}{-6} = 3$$
$$y = -3(9) + 18(3) - 14 = -27 + 54 - 14 = 13$$
Vertex: $(3, 13)$. Since $a = -3 < 0$, the parabola opens downward, so this is a **maximum**.

$$\boxed{\text{Maximum at } (3, 13)}$$

**Problem 2:** For what value of $k$ does $x^2 + kx + 4 = 0$ have exactly one real solution?

**Solution:** For one real solution, the discriminant must equal zero.
$$D = k^2 - 4(1)(4) = 0$$
$$k^2 = 16$$
$$\boxed{k = \pm 4}$$

**Problem 3:** The sum of the roots of a quadratic is $-6$ and the product is $-7$. Find the quadratic equation in standard form.

**Solution:**
$$r_1 + r_2 = -\frac{b}{a} = -6$$
$$r_1 \cdot r_2 = \frac{c}{a} = -7$$

Let $a = 1$: then $b = 6$ and $c = -7$.

$$\boxed{x^2 + 6x - 7 = 0}$$

**Problem 4:** Find all intersection points of $y = x^2 - 7x + 7$ and $y = 2x - 1$.

**Solution:** Set the equations equal:
$$x^2 - 7x + 7 = 2x - 1$$
$$x^2 - 9x + 8 = 0$$
$$(x - 1)(x - 8) = 0$$
$$x = 1 \text{ or } x = 8$$

When $x = 1$: $y = 2(1) - 1 = 1$. Point: $(1, 1)$
When $x = 8$: $y = 2(8) - 1 = 15$. Point: $(8, 15)$

$$\boxed{(1, 1) \text{ and } (8, 15)}$$

---

## PART III: SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS

### 3.1 What Is a System?

A **system of linear equations** consists of two or more linear equations considered simultaneously. The **solution** to the system is the set of all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy every equation in the system.

Geometrically, the solution represents the point(s) where the lines intersect.

---

### 3.2 Number of Solutions

A system of two linear equations can have exactly **0, 1, or infinitely many** solutions. It can NEVER have exactly 2 solutions.

| Number of Solutions | Geometric Interpretation | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| **0 solutions** | Parallel lines (never intersect) | $m_1 = m_2$ but $b_1 \neq b_2$ |
| **1 solution** | Lines intersect at one point | $m_1 \neq m_2$ |
| **Infinitely many solutions** | Same line (coincident) | $m_1 = m_2$ and $b_1 = b_2$ |

**Classification:**
- **Consistent system:** Has at least one solution (1 or infinitely many)
- **Inconsistent system:** Has no solutions (parallel lines)
- **Independent system:** Has exactly one solution (different slopes)
- **Dependent system:** Has infinitely many solutions (same line)

---

### 3.3 Method 1: Substitution

**When to use:** When one variable has a coefficient of $\pm 1$ (or can easily be isolated).

**Procedure:**
1. Solve one equation for one variable (the one with coefficient $\pm 1$).
2. Substitute that expression into the other equation.
3. Solve the resulting single-variable equation.
4. Substitute back to find the other variable.

**Example:** Solve $\begin{cases} y = 2x + 1 \\ 3x + 2y = 12 \end{cases}$

Substitute $y = 2x + 1$ into the second equation:
$$3x + 2(2x + 1) = 12$$
$$3x + 4x + 2 = 12$$
$$7x = 10$$
$$x = \frac{10}{7}$$

$$y = 2\left(\frac{10}{7}\right) + 1 = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{7}{7} = \frac{27}{7}$$

$$\boxed{\left(\frac{10}{7}, \frac{27}{7}\right)}$$

---

### 3.4 Method 2: Elimination (Addition/Subtraction)

**When to use:** When the coefficients of one variable are the same or opposites (or can be made so by multiplication).

**Procedure:**
1. Choose which variable to eliminate.
2. Multiply one or both equations by appropriate constants so the coefficients of the chosen variable are opposites.
3. Add the two equations to eliminate that variable.
4. Solve the resulting single-variable equation.
5. Substitute back to find the other variable.

**Example:** Solve $\begin{cases} 5x + 3y = 19 \\ 2x - 3y = -5 \end{cases}$

The $y$-coefficients are already opposites ($3$ and $-3$). Add the equations:
$$7x = 14$$
$$x = 2$$

Substitute into the first equation:
$$5(2) + 3y = 19$$
$$10 + 3y = 19$$
$$3y = 9$$
$$y = 3$$

$$\boxed{(2, 3)}$$

**Example requiring multiplication:** Solve $\begin{cases} 3x + 4y = 10 \\ 5x + 2y = 8 \end{cases}$

Multiply the second equation by $-2$:
$$\begin{cases} 3x + 4y = 10 \\ -10x - 4y = -16 \end{cases}$$

Add:
$$-7x = -6$$
$$x = \frac{6}{7}$$

Substitute into $3x + 4y = 10$:
$$3\left(\frac{6}{7}\right) + 4y = 10$$
$$\frac{18}{7} + 4y = 10$$
$$4y = \frac{52}{7}$$
$$y = \frac{13}{7}$$

$$\boxed{\left(\frac{6}{7}, \frac{13}{7}\right)}$$

---

### 3.5 Method 3: Graphing

**When to use:** When you need a visual understanding or when the equations are already in slope-intercept form.

**Procedure:**
1. Graph both lines on the same coordinate plane.
2. Identify the intersection point.
3. Verify by substituting into both equations.

**Note:** Graphing is the least precise method and is primarily useful for understanding the concept or checking answers.

---

### 3.6 Classification Problems

**Problem type:** "For what value of $k$ does the system have no solution / infinitely many solutions?"

**Strategy:** Convert both equations to slope-intercept form and compare slopes and intercepts.

**Example:** Find the value of $a$ for which the system $\begin{cases} 2x + 5y = a \\ 4x + 10y = 60 \end{cases}$ has infinitely many solutions.

**Solution:**
Line 1: $y = -\frac{2}{5}x + \frac{a}{5}$
Line 2: $y = -\frac{2}{5}x + 6$

The slopes are already equal ($-\frac{2}{5}$). For infinitely many solutions, the $y$-intercepts must also be equal:
$$\frac{a}{5} = 6$$
$$\boxed{a = 30}$$

**Example:** Find the value of $k$ for which the system $\begin{cases} 2x - 5y = 11 \\ kx + 10y = -22 \end{cases}$ has no solution.

**Solution:**
Line 1: $y = \frac{2}{5}x - \frac{11}{5}$, slope $= \frac{2}{5}$
Line 2: $y = -\frac{k}{10}x - \frac{22}{10}$, slope $= -\frac{k}{10}$

For no solution, slopes must be equal:
$$\frac{2}{5} = -\frac{k}{10}$$
$$k = -4$$

Check: Line 2 becomes $-4x + 10y = -22$, or $2x - 5y = 11$. Wait — this is the same as Line 1! So $k = -4$ gives infinitely many solutions, not no solution.

Let me reconsider. For no solution with the same slope, we need different intercepts. Setting slopes equal: $\frac{2}{5} = -\frac{k}{10}$ gives $k = -4$. But then Line 2: $-4x + 10y = -22$ → divide by $-2$: $2x - 5y = 11$, which IS Line 1. So $k = -4$ gives infinitely many solutions.

For no solution, we need the same slope but different intercepts. Since the slopes are $\frac{2}{5}$ and $-\frac{k}{10}$, setting $\frac{2}{5} = -\frac{k}{10}$ gives $k = -4$. But this makes the lines identical. So there is **no value of $k$** that gives no solution — when the slopes match, the lines are identical.

Actually, let me recheck. Line 2: $kx + 10y = -22$. If $k = -4$: $-4x + 10y = -22$. Divide by $-2$: $2x - 5y = 11$. This is exactly Line 1. So $k = -4$ gives infinitely many solutions.

For no solution, we'd need the same slope but a different constant. Since the constant in Line 2 is fixed at $-22$, and matching slopes forces $k = -4$ which makes the lines identical, there is no value of $k$ that produces no solution.

$$\boxed{k = -4 \text{ gives infinitely many solutions; no value of } k \text{ gives no solution}}$$

---

### 3.7 Systems of Equations Practice Problems

**Problem 1:** Solve $\begin{cases} 3x - 4y = 21 \\ 5x + 2y = -5 \end{cases}$

**Solution:** Multiply the second equation by 2:
$$\begin{cases} 3x - 4y = 21 \\ 10x + 4y = -10 \end{cases}$$

Add: $13x = 11$, so $x = \frac{11}{13}$.

Substitute into $5x + 2y = -5$:
$$5\left(\frac{11}{13}\right) + 2y = -5$$
$$\frac{55}{13} + 2y = -5$$
$$2y = -5 - \frac{55}{13} = \frac{-65 - 55}{13} = \frac{-120}{13}$$
$$y = \frac{-60}{13}$$

$$\boxed{\left(\frac{11}{13}, -\frac{60}{13}\right)}$$

**Problem 2:** A store sells two types of tickets. Student tickets cost $\$6$ and adult tickets cost $\$10$. If 150 tickets were sold for a total of $\$1,100$, how many of each type were sold?

**Solution:** Let $s$ = number of student tickets, $a$ = number of adult tickets.
$$\begin{cases} s + a = 150 \\ 6s + 10a = 1100 \end{cases}$$

From the first equation: $s = 150 - a$. Substitute:
$$6(150 - a) + 10a = 1100$$
$$900 - 6a + 10a = 1100$$
$$4a = 200$$
$$a = 50, \quad s = 100$$

$$\boxed{100 \text{ student tickets and } 50 \text{ adult tickets}}$$

**Problem 3:** For what value of $a$ does $\begin{cases} ax + 2y = 5 \\ 3x + 6y = 15 \end{cases}$ have infinitely many solutions?

**Solution:**
Line 1: $y = -\frac{a}{2}x + \frac{5}{2}$
Line 2: $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{5}{2}$

For infinitely many solutions, slopes must be equal: $-\frac{a}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}$, so $a = 1$.

Check: When $a = 1$, Line 1 is $x + 2y = 5$. Line 2 is $3x + 6y = 15$, which is $3(x + 2y) = 3(5) = 15$. Same line ✓

$$\boxed{a = 1}$$

## PART IV: COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND CHALLENGE PROBLEMS

### Challenge Problem 1 (Linear + Quadratic Intersection)

Find all points where the line $y = 2x + 3$ intersects the parabola $y = x^2 - 4x + 7$.

**Solution:**
$$x^2 - 4x + 7 = 2x + 3$$
$$x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$$
$$x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 16}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{20}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 2\sqrt{5}}{2} = 3 \pm \sqrt{5}$$

When $x = 3 + \sqrt{5}$: $y = 2(3 + \sqrt{5}) + 3 = 9 + 2\sqrt{5}$
When $x = 3 - \sqrt{5}$: $y = 2(3 - \sqrt{5}) + 3 = 9 - 2\sqrt{5}$

$$\boxed{(3 + \sqrt{5},\ 9 + 2\sqrt{5}) \text{ and } (3 - \sqrt{5},\ 9 - 2\sqrt{5})}$$

---

### Challenge Problem 2 (System with a Parameter)

Find all values of $k$ for which the system $\begin{cases} y = kx + 4 \\ y = x^2 - 2x + 1 \end{cases}$ has exactly one solution.

**Solution:** Set equal:
$$kx + 4 = x^2 - 2x + 1$$
$$x^2 - (k+2)x - 3 = 0$$

For exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero:
$$D = (k+2)^2 - 4(1)(-3) = 0$$
$$(k+2)^2 + 12 = 0$$
$$(k+2)^2 = -12$$

Since a squared real number cannot be negative, there is **no real value of $k$** for which the system has exactly one solution.

Wait — let me recheck. The problem says "exactly one solution," meaning the line is tangent to the parabola. But the discriminant $(k+2)^2 + 12$ is always positive (minimum value is 12 when $k = -2$). So the line always intersects the parabola at two points.

$$\boxed{\text{No real value of } k \text{ gives exactly one solution.}}$$

---

### Challenge Problem 3 (Three-Variable System)

Solve $\begin{cases} x + y + z = 6 \\ 2x - y + z = 3 \\ x + 2y - z = 2 \end{cases}$

**Solution:**

From Equation 1: $z = 6 - x - y$

Substitute into Equation 2:
$$2x - y + (6 - x - y) = 3$$
$$x - 2y + 6 = 3$$
$$x - 2y = -3 \quad \text{...(4)}$$

Substitute into Equation 3:
$$x + 2y - (6 - x - y) = 2$$
$$x + 2y - 6 + x + y = 2$$
$$2x + 3y = 8 \quad \text{...(5)}$$

From (4): $x = 2y - 3$. Substitute into (5):
$$2(2y - 3) + 3y = 8$$
$$4y - 6 + 3y = 8$$
$$7y = 14$$
$$y = 2$$

Then $x = 2(2) - 3 = 1$, and $z = 6 - 1 - 2 = 3$.

$$\boxed{(1, 2, 3)}$$

### Challenge Problem 4 (Quadratic Modeling)

A ball is thrown upward from a height of 5 feet with an initial velocity of 40 feet per second. The height $h$ (in feet) after $t$ seconds is modeled by $h = -16t^2 + 40t + 5$.

(a) What is the maximum height reached?
(b) When does the ball hit the ground?

**Solution:**

(a) The maximum height occurs at the vertex:
$$t = -\frac{40}{2(-16)} = \frac{40}{32} = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \text{ seconds}$$

$$h = -16\left(\frac{5}{4}\right)^2 + 40\left(\frac{5}{4}\right) + 5 = -16\left(\frac{25}{16}\right) + 50 + 5 = -25 + 55 = 30$$

$$\boxed{\text{Maximum height} = 30 \text{ feet at } t = 1.25 \text{ seconds}}$$

(b) The ball hits the ground when $h = 0$:
$$-16t^2 + 40t + 5 = 0$$
$$16t^2 - 40t - 5 = 0$$
$$t = \frac{40 \pm \sqrt{1600 + 320}}{32} = \frac{40 \pm \sqrt{1920}}{32} = \frac{40 \pm 8\sqrt{30}}{32} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{30}}{4}$$

Since $t > 0$: $t = \frac{5 + \sqrt{30}}{4} \approx \frac{5 + 5.48}{4} \approx 2.62$ seconds

$$\boxed{t = \frac{5 + \sqrt{30}}{4} \approx 2.62 \text{ seconds}}$$

# Chapter 2: Deep-Dive Explanations — Slope Theory, Equation Modeling, and Standard-form Conversions

## 2.1 The Concept of Slope: A Rigorous Foundation

The slope of a line is arguably the most fundamental concept in all of algebra. It is the single number that determines the "tilt" of a line, its direction, and its rate of change. Before we can model real-world scenarios or convert between equation forms, we must possess an unshakable understanding of what slope is, how to calculate it, and what every possible value of slope implies visually.

### 2.1.1 Definition and Formula

The slope, commonly denoted by the variable $m$, is defined as the ratio of the vertical change (the "rise") to the horizontal change (the "run") between any two distinct points on a line.

Given two points, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, where $x_1 \neq x_2$, the slope is calculated as:

$$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

**Critical Nuance:** The order of the points does not matter, provided you are consistent. If you subtract $y_1$ from $y_2$ in the numerator, you *must* subtract $x_1$ from $x_2$ in the denominator. If you reverse the order in one but not the other, the sign of the slope will be incorrect.

### 2.1.2 Interpreting the Value of Slope

The numerical value of the slope tells a story about the line's behavior:

*   **Positive Slope ($m > 0$):** The line rises from left to right. As $x$ increases, $y$ increases. The steeper the line, the larger the value of $m$.
*   **Negative Slope ($m < 0$):** The line falls from left to right. As $x$ increases, $y$ decreases. The steeper the downward tilt, the more negative the value of $m$ (e.g., $-5$ is steeper than $-1$).
*   **Zero Slope ($m = 0$):** The line is perfectly horizontal. There is no vertical change regardless of the horizontal change. The equation of such a line is $y = k$, where $k$ is the y-coordinate of any point on the line.
*   **Undefined Slope:** The line is perfectly vertical. There is no horizontal change ($\Delta x = 0$), which makes the fraction undefined. The equation of such a line is $x = h$, where $h$ is the x-coordinate of any point on the line.

### 2.1.3 Slope as a Rate of Change

In applied mathematics and science, the slope is rarely just an abstract number. It represents a **rate of change**. If $x$ represents time in seconds and $y$ represents distance in meters, the slope $m$ represents velocity in meters per second. If $x$ represents the number of units produced and $y$ represents total cost in dollars, the slope represents the marginal cost per unit.

The units of the slope are always the units of the dependent variable ($y$) divided by the units of the independent variable ($x$).

## 2.2 The Three Forms of a Linear Equation

A single straight line can be described by multiple algebraic equations. The "best" form to use depends entirely on the information you are given and the question you are trying to answer. The SAT and ACT will test your ability to fluently navigate between these three forms.

### 2.2.1 Slope-Intercept Form: $y = mx + b$

This is the most common and arguably the most useful form for graphing and quick analysis.

*   **$m$**: The slope of the line.
*   **$b$**: The y-intercept (the value of $y$ when $x = 0$). This is the point $(0, b)$.

**When to use it:** Use this form when you are given the slope and the y-intercept, or when you need to quickly identify the slope and y-intercept of a line. It is also the most efficient form for graphing a line by hand.

**Derivation Insight:** If a line passes through the origin $(0,0)$ with slope $m$, the equation is simply $y = mx$. If that line is then shifted vertically by $b$ units, every $y$-coordinate increases by $b$, resulting in $y = mx + b$.

### 2.2.2 Point-Slope Form: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

This form is the most powerful tool for writing the equation of a line when you are given a single point and the slope.

*   **$m$**: The slope of the line.
*   **$(x_1, y_1)$**: A specific point that lies on the line.

**When to use it:** Use this form when you are given the slope and a single point (not the y-intercept), or when you are given two points and you have already calculated the slope.

**Derivation Insight:** The logic behind this form is simple. The slope $m$ must be the same between *any* two points on the line. If $(x_1, y_1)$ is a fixed point and $(x, y)$ represents *any* other point on the line, then the slope formula gives us $m = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}$. Multiplying both sides by $(x - x_1)$ yields the point-slope form.

### 2.2.3 Standard Form: $Ax + By = C$

This form is often preferred in higher mathematics and systems of equations.

*   **$A$, $B$, $C$**: Integers (usually, though not strictly required). It is standard convention that $A$ should be a non-negative integer.
*   **$A$ and $B$**: Cannot both be zero.

**When to use it:** Use this form when dealing with systems of linear equations (elimination method) or when the problem specifically asks for it. It is also useful for finding intercepts quickly (set $y=0$ to find x-intercept, set $x=0$ to find y-intercept).

**Finding Slope from Standard Form:** A common task is to find the slope of a line given in standard form. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $y$:
$$By = -Ax + C$$
$$y = -\frac{A}{B}x + \frac{C}{B}$$
Therefore, the slope $m = -\frac{A}{B}$.

## 2.3 Mastering Conversions Between Forms

The ability to seamlessly convert a linear equation from one form to another is a non-negotiable skill for standardized testing. This section provides the step-by-step algorithms for every possible conversion.

### 2.3.1 Standard Form to Slope-Intercept Form

**Goal:** Isolate $y$ to identify $m$ and $b$.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Move the $x$-term to the right side of the equation by subtracting $Ax$ from both sides.
2.  Divide every term by the coefficient of $y$ (which is $B$).

**Example:** Convert $4x + 2y = 10$ to slope-intercept form.
1.  $2y = -4x + 10$
2.  $y = -2x + 5$
*Result: Slope $m = -2$, y-intercept $b = 5$.*

### 2.3.2 Slope-Intercept Form to Standard Form

**Goal:** Move all variable terms to one side and ensure coefficients are integers.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Move the $mx$ term to the left side by subtracting it from both sides.
2.  If there are any fractions, multiply the entire equation by the Least Common Denominator (LCD) to clear them.
3.  Ensure the $x$-coefficient is positive (multiply by $-1$ if necessary).

**Example:** Convert $y = \frac{2}{3}x - 4$ to standard form.
1.  $-\frac{2}{3}x + y = -4$
2.  Multiply by 3: $-2x + 3y = -12$
3.  Multiply by $-1$: $2x - 3y = 12$
*Result: $A = 2$, $B = -3$, $C = 12$.*

### 2.3.3 Point-Slope Form to Slope-Intercept Form

**Goal:** Distribute the slope and isolate $y$.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Distribute $m$ to the terms inside the parentheses.
2.  Add $y_1$ to both sides to isolate $y$.
3.  Combine constant terms on the right side.

**Example:** Convert $y - 5 = 3(x - 2)$ to slope-intercept form.
1.  $y - 5 = 3x - 6$
2.  $y = 3x - 6 + 5$
3.  $y = 3x - 1$
*Result: Slope $m = 3$, y-intercept $b = -1$.*

### 2.3.4 Two Points to Point-Slope Form

**Goal:** Calculate slope, then plug into point-slope formula.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Calculate $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.
2.  Choose *one* of the two points to be $(x_1, y_1)$.
3.  Substitute $m$, $x_1$, and $y_1$ into $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$.

**Example:** Find the equation of the line passing through $(1, 2)$ and $(5, 10)$.
1.  $m = \frac{10 - 2}{5 - 1} = \frac{8}{4} = 2$.
2.  Let $(x_1, y_1) = (1, 2)$.
3.  $y - 2 = 2(x - 1)$.
*Result: Point-slope form is $y - 2 = 2(x - 1)$.*

## 2.4 Parallel and Perpendicular Lines: The Geometric Relationships

Understanding the relationship between the slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines is a staple of the SAT and ACT. These relationships allow you to determine the equation of a line based solely on its relationship to another line.

### 2.4.1 Parallel Lines

**Definition:** Two lines are parallel if and only if they lie in the same plane and never intersect.

**Slope Relationship:** Parallel lines have the **exact same slope** ($m_1 = m_2$).

**Why?** If two lines have different slopes, they will eventually cross. Only lines with identical tilts will remain equidistant forever.

**Application:** If you are asked to find the equation of a line parallel to $y = 3x - 7$ that passes through the point $(2, 4)$, you immediately know the slope of your new line is $m = 3$. You can then use point-slope form: $y - 4 = 3(x - 2)$.

### 2.4.2 Perpendicular Lines

**Definition:** Two lines are perpendicular if they intersect at a right angle (90 degrees).

**Slope Relationship:** Perpendicular lines have slopes that are **negative reciprocals** of each other ($m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}$ or $m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$).

**Why?** This is a geometric necessity. If one line has a steep positive slope, the line perpendicular to it must have a slope that "cancels out" the tilt to form a right angle.

**Application:** If you are asked to find the equation of a line perpendicular to $y = 3x - 7$ that passes through $(2, 4)$, the slope of the new line is the negative reciprocal of $3$, which is $-\frac{1}{3}$. Using point-slope form: $y - 4 = -\frac{1}{3}(x - 2)$.

**Special Cases:**
*   A horizontal line ($m = 0$) is perpendicular to a vertical line (undefined slope).
*   A line with slope $1$ is perpendicular to a line with slope $-1$.

## 2.5 Modeling Real-World Scenarios with Linear Equations

The SAT and ACT frequently present word problems that require you to translate a real-world situation into a linear equation. This section breaks down the common components of these problems.

### 2.5.1 Identifying the Variables

The first step is always to define what $x$ and $y$ represent.

*   **$x$ (Independent Variable):** The input, the thing you control, or the thing that changes naturally (e.g., time, number of items, years since a starting point).
*   **$y$ (Dependent Variable):** The output, the thing you are measuring, the thing that depends on $x$ (e.g., total cost, distance traveled, population).

### 2.5.2 Interpreting Slope and Y-Intercept in Context

This is the most critical skill for word problems. You must be able to explain what $m$ and $b$ mean *in the context of the problem*, not just mathematically.

*   **The Slope ($m$):** Represents the **rate of change** or the **unit rate**. It answers the question: "How much does $y$ increase (or decrease) for every 1-unit increase in $x$?"
    *   *Example:* If $y$ is the total cost of buying $x$ apples at $0.50 each, the slope $m = 0.50$ means "the cost increases by $0.50 for every 1 apple purchased."
*   **The Y-Intercept ($b$):** Represents the **starting value** or **initial condition**. It is the value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
    *   *Example:* If $y$ is the total cost of a taxi ride where $x$ is the number of miles traveled, and there is a $3.00 base fare, the y-intercept $b = 3$ means "the cost is $3.00 before traveling any miles."

### 2.5.3 Common Linear Modeling Scenarios

1.  **Financial Models:**
    *   $y = \text{rate} \cdot x + \text{initial amount}$
    *   *Example:* A gym charges a $50 membership fee plus $20 per month. $y = 20x + 50$.

2.  **Distance/Rate/Time Models:**
    *   $y = \text{speed} \cdot x + \text{starting distance}$
    *   *Example:* A car is 100 miles away and drives towards you at 60 mph. $y = -60x + 100$ (distance decreases over time).

3.  **Mixture/Combination Models:**
    *   $y = (\text{cost}_1 \cdot \text{amount}_1) + (\text{cost}_2 \cdot \text{amount}_2)$
    *   Often, these involve constraints that lead to systems of equations.

### 2.5.4 Constructing the Equation from a Word Problem

**Algorithm:**
1.  Read the problem and identify the independent ($x$) and dependent ($y$) variables.
2.  Find the **rate of change** (the slope, $m$). Look for keywords like "per," "each," "every," or "rate."
3.  Find the **starting value** (the y-intercept, $b$). Look for keywords like "initial," "starting," "base fee," or "one-time charge."
4.  Plug $m$ and $b$ into $y = mx + b$.

**Advanced Scenario: Two-Point Modeling**
Sometimes, the problem doesn't explicitly give you the slope or the y-intercept. Instead, it gives you two specific data points, e.g., "In 2020, the population was 5,000. In 2025, it was 7,000."

**Algorithm:**
1.  Convert the data points into coordinate pairs: $(2020, 5000)$ and $(2025, 7000)$.
2.  Calculate the slope: $m = \frac{7000 - 5000}{2025 - 2020} = \frac{2000}{5} = 400$.
3.  Interpret the slope: "The population increases by 400 people per year."
4.  Use point-slope form to find the equation: $y - 5000 = 400(x - 2020)$.
5.  Simplify to slope-intercept form if needed: $y = 400x - 795,000$.

---

## 2.6 Common Pitfalls and Test-Taking Strategies

### 2.6.1 The "Undefined vs. Zero" Slope Confusion

This is one of the most common errors in algebra.

*   **Zero Slope:** The line is horizontal. The equation is $y = \text{constant}$. (Think: A flat road has zero steepness).
*   **Undefined Slope:** The line is vertical. The equation is $x = \text{constant}$. (Think: A cliff is infinitely steep).

**Memory Trick:** "0" looks like a flat line (horizontal). "Undefined" is a word that goes straight up and down (vertical).

### 2.6.2 Sign Errors in Slope Calculation

When calculating slope between two points, always be vigilant with negative signs.

**Example:** Find the slope between $(-2, 5)$ and $(4, -1)$.
$$m = \frac{-1 - 5}{4 - (-2)} = \frac{-6}{4 + 2} = \frac{-6}{6} = -1$$
Notice how subtracting a negative number becomes addition. This is where many students make mistakes.

### 2.6.3 Misinterpreting the Y-Intercept

The y-intercept is *not* always the answer to "what is the value at the beginning?" If the equation is written in standard form ($Ax + By = C$), the y-intercept is *not* $C$. It is $C/B$.

**Example:** In the equation $2x + 3y = 6$, the y-intercept is $6/3 = 2$, not 6.

### 2.6.4 Parallel vs. Perpendicular Mix-Ups

Students often confuse the two rules.

*   **Parallel:** Same slope. (Think: Parallel train tracks have the same direction).
*   **Perpendicular:** Negative reciprocal. (Think: A perpendicular line "flips" the slope and changes its sign).

**Memory Trick:** To find the perpendicular slope, "flip the fraction and change the sign." If $m = 2/3$, the perpendicular slope is $-3/2$.

### 2.6.5 Standard Form Conventions

When converting to standard form, the SAT and ACT usually expect $A$, $B$, and $C$ to be integers, and $A$ to be non-negative. If you end up with $-3x + 2y = 5$, multiply the entire equation by $-1$ to get $3x - 2y = -5$.

---

## 2.7 Practice Problems: Deep-Dive Application

### Problem Set A: Finding Equations

**1.** Find the equation of the line in slope-intercept form that passes through the point $(3, -2)$ and has a slope of $4$.

**2.** Find the equation of the line in point-slope form that passes through the points $(1, 5)$ and $(3, 11)$.

**3.** Find the equation of the line in standard form that passes through $(-1, 4)$ and $(2, -2)$.

**4.** Find the equation of the line parallel to $y = 2x - 5$ that passes through the point $(4, 1)$.

**5.** Find the equation of the line perpendicular to $y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 2$ that passes through the point $(6, -2)$.

### Problem Set B: Interpretation and Modeling

**6.** A plumber charges a $75 service fee plus $50 per hour of work. Write a linear equation representing the total cost $y$ as a function of hours worked $x$. What does the slope represent? What does the y-intercept represent?

**7.** A car rental company charges $30 per day plus a one-time insurance fee of $15. Write the equation in standard form representing the total cost $y$ for renting $x$ days.

**8.** In 2010, a town's population was 12,000. In 2020, it was 18,000. Assuming a linear growth model, write the equation representing the population $y$ as a function of the number of years $x$ since 2010. Use this model to predict the population in 2030.

## 2.8 Solutions and Step-by-Step Explanations

**Solution 1:**
Given $m = 4$ and point $(3, -2)$.
Use point-slope form: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$.
$y - (-2) = 4(x - 3)$
$y + 2 = 4x - 12$
$y = 4x - 14$

**Solution 2:**
Given points $(1, 5)$ and $(3, 11)$.
First, find the slope: $m = \frac{11 - 5}{3 - 1} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$.
Use point-slope form with $(1, 5)$: $y - 5 = 3(x - 1)$.
(Note: Using $(3, 11)$ would give $y - 11 = 3(x - 3)$, which is equivalent).

**Solution 3:**
Given points $(-1, 4)$ and $(2, -2)$.
First, find the slope: $m = \frac{-2 - 4}{2 - (-1)} = \frac{-6}{3} = -2$.
Use point-slope form: $y - 4 = -2(x - (-1)) \Rightarrow y - 4 = -2(x + 1)$.
$y - 4 = -2x - 2$
$y = -2x + 2$
Convert to standard form: $2x + y = 2$.

**Solution 4:**
Parallel to $y = 2x - 5$ means the slope is the same: $m = 2$.
Passing through $(4, 1)$.
$y - 1 = 2(x - 4)$
$y - 1 = 2x - 8$
$y = 2x - 7$

**Solution 5:**
Perpendicular to $y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 2$ means the slope is the negative reciprocal: $m = 3$.
Passing through $(6, -2)$.
$y - (-2) = 3(x - 6)$
$y + 2 = 3x - 18$
$y = 3x - 20$

**Solution 6:**
$y = 50x + 75$.
The slope ($m = 50$) represents the hourly rate ($50 per hour).
The y-intercept ($b = 75$) represents the one-time service fee ($75).

**Solution 7:**
$y = 30x + 15$.
To convert to standard form: $-30x + y = 15$.
Multiply by $-1$ to make $A$ positive: $30x - y = -15$.

**Solution 8:**
Points: $(0, 12000)$ and $(10, 18000)$.
Slope: $m = \frac{18000 - 12000}{10 - 0} = \frac{6000}{10} = 600$.
Equation: $y = 600x + 12000$.
For 2030, $x = 20$: $y = 600(20) + 12000 = 12000 + 12000 = 24000$.
The predicted population in 2030 is 24,000.

# Chapter 3: Advanced Strategies for Systems — No Solution, Infinite Solutions, and Real-World Modeling

## 3.1 The Anatomy of a System: A Rigorous Foundation

Before we can dissect the behavior of linear systems, we must establish a precise mathematical vocabulary. A **system of linear equations** consists of two or more equations involving the same set of variables. The solution to such a system is the set of all ordered pairs (or tuples, for more than two variables) that simultaneously satisfy every equation in the system.

Consider the general form of a system of two linear equations in two variables:

$$a_1x + b_1y = c_1$$
$$a_2x + b_2y = c_2$$

Where $a_1, b_1, c_1, a_2, b_2, c_2$ are real number constants, and $x$ and $y$ are the variables.

The **solution set** of this system can contain exactly one of three possibilities:
1.  **Exactly one solution:** The lines intersect at a single, unique point.
2.  **No solution:** The lines are parallel and distinct, never intersecting.
3.  **Infinitely many solutions:** The lines are coincident (the exact same line), overlapping at every point.

This trichotomy is absolute. For two linear equations in two variables, there is no fourth possibility. The number of solutions is an intrinsic property of the system's structure, determined solely by the relationships between the coefficients.

---

## 3.2 The Geometric-Analytic Bridge: Slope and Intercept Relationships

To understand *why* these three cases occur, we must bridge the algebraic and geometric perspectives. Every linear equation in two variables can be rewritten in **slope-intercept form** ($y = mx + b$), where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.

Let us transform our general system:

Equation 1: $y = -\frac{a_1}{b_1}x + \frac{c_1}{b_1}$ (assuming $b_1 \neq 0$)
Equation 2: $y = -\frac{a_2}{b_2}x + \frac{c_2}{b_2}$ (assuming $b_2 \neq 0$)

Let $m_1 = -\frac{a_1}{b_1}$ and $m_2 = -\frac{a_2}{b_2}$ be the slopes.
Let $b_1^* = \frac{c_1}{b_1}$ and $b_2^* = \frac{c_2}{b_2}$ be the y-intercepts.

The three cases can now be defined precisely:

*   **Case 1: Unique Solution ($m_1 \neq m_2$)**
    If the slopes are different, the lines *must* intersect at exactly one point. The x-coordinate of this point can be found by setting the two expressions for $y$ equal to each other:
    $$m_1x + b_1^* = m_2x + b_2^*$$
    $$(m_1 - m_2)x = b_2^* - b_1^*$$
    $$x = \frac{b_2^* - b_1^*}{m_1 - m_2}$$
    Since $m_1 \neq m_2$, the denominator is non-zero, guaranteeing a unique value for $x$. Substituting this back into either equation yields the unique $y$-coordinate.

*   **Case 2: No Solution ($m_1 = m_2$ and $b_1^* \neq b_2^*$)**
    If the slopes are identical, the lines are parallel. Parallel lines never intersect. If the y-intercepts are different ($b_1^* \neq b_2^*$), the lines are distinct and separate. There is no point $(x, y)$ that lies on both lines simultaneously. The system is **inconsistent**.

*   **Case 3: Infinitely Many Solutions ($m_1 = m_2$ and $b_1^* = b_2^*$)**
    If the slopes are identical and the y-intercepts are identical, the two equations represent the exact same line. Every point on this line is a solution to both equations. The system is **dependent** (or consistent-dependent). The solution set can be expressed as $\{(x, y) \ | \ y = m_1x + b_1^*\}$.

---

## 3.3 The Determinant: A Powerful Algebraic Tool

While the slope-intercept method is conceptually clear, it fails when lines are vertical (slope is undefined). A more robust, universal method exists using the **determinant** of the coefficient matrix.

For our system:
$$a_1x + b_1y = c_1$$
$$a_2x + b_2y = c_2$$

The **coefficient matrix** is:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 & b_1 \\ a_2 & b_2 \end{pmatrix}$$

The **determinant** of $A$, denoted $\det(A)$ or $|A|$, is calculated as:
$$\det(A) = a_1b_2 - a_2b_1$$

The determinant provides a definitive test for the nature of the solution:

*   **If $\det(A) \neq 0$:** The system has **exactly one unique solution**. The matrix $A$ is invertible, and the solution can be found using **Cramer's Rule**:
    $$x = \frac{\det(A_x)}{\det(A)}, \quad y = \frac{\det(A_y)}{\det(A)}$$
    Where $A_x$ is the matrix formed by replacing the first column of $A$ with the constants vector $\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \end{pmatrix}$, and $A_y$ is formed by replacing the second column.
    $$A_x = \begin{pmatrix} c_1 & b_1 \\ c_2 & b_2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad A_y = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 & c_1 \\ a_2 & c_2 \end{pmatrix}$$

*   **If $\det(A) = 0$:** The system has either **no solution** or **infinitely many solutions**. The matrix $A$ is singular (non-invertible). To distinguish between these two sub-cases, we must examine the **augmented matrix**:
    $$[A | \mathbf{c}] = \left(\begin{array}{cc|c} a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\ a_2 & b_2 & c_2 \end{array}\right)$$

---

## 3.4 Distinguishing No Solution from Infinite Solutions: The Rank Method

When $\det(A) = 0$, we must perform a deeper analysis. The key concept here is the **rank** of a matrix, which is the number of non-zero rows in its **row echelon form (REF)**.

Let's apply **Gaussian elimination** to the augmented matrix:

1.  Start with: $\left(\begin{array}{cc|c} a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\ a_2 & b_2 & c_2 \end{array}\right)$
2.  Perform row operations to get a zero in the second row, first column. Multiply Row 1 by $a_2$ and Row 2 by $a_1$, then subtract:
    $$R_2 \leftarrow a_1R_2 - a_2R_1$$
    This yields: $\left(\begin{array}{cc|c} a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\ 0 & a_1b_2 - a_2b_1 & a_1c_2 - a_2c_1 \end{array}\right)$

Since $\det(A) = a_1b_2 - a_2b_1 = 0$, the second row simplifies to:
$$\left(\begin{array}{cc|c} a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\ 0 & 0 & a_1c_2 - a_2c_1 \end{array}\right)$$

Now we examine the value of $a_1c_2 - a_2c_1$:

*   **Sub-case 2a: No Solution (Inconsistent System)**
    If $a_1c_2 - a_2c_1 \neq 0$, the second row reads $0x + 0y = \text{non-zero}$, which is a contradiction. This means the system has **no solution**. The lines are parallel and distinct.
    In terms of rank: $\text{rank}(A) = 1$ (only one non-zero row in the coefficient matrix), but $\text{rank}([A | \mathbf{c}]) = 2$ (the augmented matrix has two non-zero rows). Since $\text{rank}(A) \neq \text{rank}([A | \mathbf{c}])$, the system is inconsistent.

*   **Sub-case 3b: Infinitely Many Solutions (Dependent System)**
    If $a_1c_2 - a_2c_1 = 0$, the second row reads $0x + 0y = 0$, which is always true and provides no new information. The system reduces to a single equation: $a_1x + b_1y = c_1$. This means there are **infinitely many solutions**.
    In terms of rank: $\text{rank}(A) = 1$ and $\text{rank}([A | \mathbf{c}]) = 1$. Since $\text{rank}(A) = \text{rank}([A | \mathbf{c}])$, the system is consistent. Because the rank (1) is less than the number of variables (2), there are infinitely many solutions. The solution set has one **free variable** (parameter).

---

## 3.5 Parametric Representation of Infinite Solutions

When a system has infinitely many solutions, we express the solution set using a **parameter**. Let's continue from the dependent case where the system reduces to:
$$a_1x + b_1y = c_1$$

Assuming $b_1 \neq 0$, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$:
$$y = \frac{c_1 - a_1x}{b_1}$$

Let $x = t$, where $t$ is any real number (the parameter). Then:
$$x = t$$
$$y = \frac{c_1 - a_1t}{b_1}$$

The solution set is $\{(t, \frac{c_1 - a_1t}{b_1}) \ | \ t \in \mathbb{R}\}$.

If $b_1 = 0$ (and thus $a_1 \neq 0$), the equation becomes $a_1x = c_1$, so $x = \frac{c_1}{a_1}$. Let $y = t$:
$$x = \frac{c_1}{a_1}$$
$$y = t$$

The solution set is $\{(\frac{c_1}{a_1}, t) \ | \ t \in \mathbb{R}\}$.

This parametric form is essential for describing the entire infinite family of solutions.

## 3.6 Real-World Modeling: Translating Word Problems into Systems

The true power of linear systems lies in their application to real-world scenarios. The modeling process requires careful translation of verbal descriptions into mathematical equations.

### 3.6.1 The Mixture Problem Framework

**Scenario:** A chemist needs to create 100 liters of a 30% acid solution. They have two stock solutions available: a 20% solution and a 50% solution. How many liters of each stock solution should be mixed?

**Modeling Process:**
1.  **Define Variables:**
    *   Let $x$ = liters of 20% solution
    *   Let $y$ = liters of 50% solution
2.  **Identify Constraints:**
    *   **Total Volume Constraint:** The final mixture must be 100 liters.
        $$x + y = 100$$
    *   **Total Acid Constraint:** The amount of pure acid from both sources must equal the amount of pure acid in the final mixture.
        $$0.20x + 0.50y = 0.30(100)$$
        $$0.20x + 0.50y = 30$$
3.  **Solve the System:**
    From the first equation: $y = 100 - x$
    Substitute into the second equation:
    $$0.20x + 0.50(100 - x) = 30$$
    $$0.20x + 50 - 0.50x = 30$$
    $$-0.30x = -20$$
    $$x = \frac{20}{0.30} = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67 \text{ liters}$$
    $$y = 100 - \frac{200}{3} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \text{ liters}$$

**Verification:**
*   Total volume: $\frac{200}{3} + \frac{100}{3} = \frac{300}{3} = 100$ liters. (Correct)
*   Total acid: $0.20(\frac{200}{3}) + 0.50(\frac{100}{3}) = \frac{40}{3} + \frac{50}{3} = \frac{90}{3} = 30$ liters. (Correct)

### 3.6.2 The Motion Problem Framework

**Scenario:** Two cars start from the same point. Car A travels north at 60 mph. Car B travels east at 80 mph. After how many hours will they be 500 miles apart?

**Modeling Process:**
1.  **Define Variables:**
    *   Let $t$ = time in hours
    *   Let $d_A$ = distance traveled by Car A = $60t$
    *   Let $d_B$ = distance traveled by Car B = $80t$
2.  **Identify the Relationship:**
    The paths of the cars form a right triangle. The distance between them is the hypotenuse.
    $$d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 500^2$$
    $$(60t)^2 + (80t)^2 = 250,000$$
    $$3600t^2 + 6400t^2 = 250,000$$
    $$10,000t^2 = 250,000$$
    $$t^2 = 25$$
    $$t = 5 \text{ hours}$$ (We discard $t = -5$ as time cannot be negative)

### 3.6.3 The Economic Problem Framework (Break-Even Analysis)

**Scenario:** A company produces widgets. The fixed costs are $5,000 per month, and the variable cost is $4 per widget. The widgets are sold for $10 each. How many widgets must be sold to break even?

**Modeling Process:**
1.  **Define Variables:**
    *   Let $x$ = number of widgets produced and sold
    *   Let $C(x)$ = total cost = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost = $5000 + 4x$
    *   Let $R(x)$ = total revenue = Price × Quantity = $10x$
2.  **Identify the Break-Even Condition:**
    At the break-even point, Revenue equals Cost.
    $$R(x) = C(x)$$
    $$10x = 5000 + 4x$$
    $$6x = 5000$$
    $$x = \frac{5000}{6} \approx 833.33$$

Since the company cannot sell a fraction of a widget, they must sell at least **834 widgets** to break even.

## 3.7 Advanced Classification: Consistent vs. Inconsistent Systems

We can now formalize the classification of any linear system of two equations:

| Condition | Rank(A) | Rank([A|c]) | Number of Solutions | System Type | Geometric Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\det(A) \neq 0$ | 2 | 2 | Exactly 1 | Consistent & Independent | Intersecting Lines |
| $\det(A) = 0$ and $a_1c_2 - a_2c_1 \neq 0$ | 1 | 2 | 0 | Inconsistent | Parallel, Distinct Lines |
| $\det(A) = 0$ and $a_1c_2 - a_2c_1 = 0$ | 1 | 1 | Infinitely Many | Consistent & Dependent | Coincident Lines |

This table is a diagnostic tool. Given any system, you can compute the determinant and the rank to immediately classify it without needing to fully solve it.

## 3.8 Practice Problems: A Deep Dive

### Problem 1: The Parameter-Dependent System

For what value of the constant $k$ does the following system have **no solution**?
$$2x + 3y = 7$$
$$4x + ky = 10$$

**Solution:**

We use the determinant condition. For no solution, we need $\det(A) = 0$ and the system to be inconsistent.

1.  Compute the determinant:
    $$\det(A) = (2)(k) - (4)(3) = 2k - 12$$
2.  Set the determinant to zero to find the critical value of $k$:
    $$2k - 12 = 0 \implies k = 6$$
3.  Verify inconsistency for $k = 6$:
    The augmented matrix becomes:
    $$\left(\begin{array}{cc|c} 2 & 3 & 7 \\ 4 & 6 & 10 \end{array}\right)$$
    Perform row reduction: $R_2 \leftarrow R_2 - 2R_1$
    $$\left(\begin{array}{cc|c} 2 & 3 & 7 \\ 0 & 0 & -4 \end{array}\right)$$
    The second row reads $0x + 0y = -4$, which is a contradiction.

**Answer:** The system has no solution when $k = 6$.

---

### Problem 2: The Infinite Solutions Case

Find the complete solution set for the system:
$$3x - 2y = 6$$
$$-6x + 4y = -12$$

**Solution:**

1.  Compute the determinant:
    $$\det(A) = (3)(4) - (-6)(-2) = 12 - 12 = 0$$
    The determinant is zero, so we have either no solution or infinitely many solutions.
2.  Check for inconsistency. The augmented matrix is:
    $$\left(\begin{array}{cc|c} 3 & -2 & 6 \\ -6 & 4 & -12 \end{array}\right)$$
    Perform row reduction: $R_2 \leftarrow R_2 + 2R_1$
    $$\left(\begin{array}{cc|c} 3 & -2 & 6 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right)$$
    The second row is all zeros, indicating a dependent system with infinitely many solutions.
3.  Express the solution set. The system reduces to $3x - 2y = 6$.
    Solve for $y$: $2y = 3x - 6 \implies y = \frac{3}{2}x - 3$.
    Let $x = t$ (where $t \in \mathbb{R}$). Then $y = \frac{3}{2}t - 3$.

**Answer:** The solution set is $\{(t, \frac{3}{2}t - 3) \ | \ t \in \mathbb{R}\}$.

---

### Problem 3: The Unique Solution via Cramer's Rule

Solve the system using Cramer's Rule:
$$5x - 2y = 14$$
$$3x + 4y = 2$$

**Solution:**

1.  Compute the determinant of the coefficient matrix:
    $$\det(A) = (5)(4) - (3)(-2) = 20 + 6 = 26$$
    Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, a unique solution exists.
2.  Compute $\det(A_x)$:
    $$A_x = \begin{pmatrix} 14 & -2 \\ 2 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$$
    $$\det(A_x) = (14)(4) - (2)(-2) = 56 + 4 = 60$$
3.  Compute $\det(A_y)$:
    $$A_y = \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 14 \\ 3 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$$
    $$\det(A_y) = (5)(2) - (3)(14) = 10 - 42 = -32$$
4.  Apply Cramer's Rule:
    $$x = \frac{\det(A_x)}{\det(A)} = \frac{60}{26} = \frac{30}{13}$$
    $$y = \frac{\det(A_y)}{\det(A)} = \frac{-32}{26} = -\frac{16}{13}$$

**Answer:** The unique solution is $(\frac{30}{13}, -\frac{16}{13})$.

---

### Problem 4: A Complex Real-World Model (The Blending Problem)

A coffee merchant wants to create a blend of two types of coffee: Type A costs $8 per pound and Type B costs $12 per pound. The merchant wants to make 200 pounds of a blend that costs $10 per pound. How many pounds of each type should be used?

**Solution:**

1.  **Define Variables:**
    *   Let $x$ = pounds of Type A coffee
    *   Let $y$ = pounds of Type B coffee
2.  **Set Up the System:**
    *   Total weight: $x + y = 200$
    *   Total cost: $8x + 12y = 10(200) = 2000$
3.  **Solve the System:**
    From the first equation: $y = 200 - x$
    Substitute into the second equation:
    $$8x + 12(200 - x) = 2000$$
    $$8x + 2400 - 12x = 2000$$
    $$-4x = -400$$
    $$x = 100 \text{ pounds}$$
    $$y = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}$$

**Verification:**
*   Total weight: $100 + 100 = 200$ pounds. (Correct)
*   Total cost: $8(100) + 12(100) = 800 + 1200 = 2000$ dollars. (Correct)
*   Average cost: $\frac{2000}{200} = 10$ dollars per pound. (Correct)

**Answer:** The merchant should use 100 pounds of Type A and 100 pounds of Type B.

### Problem 5: The Break-Even Point with Non-Linear Revenue (Advanced)

A small business has fixed costs of $2,000 per month and variable costs of $15 per unit. The price-demand relationship is given by $p(x) = 50 - 0.02x$, where $p$ is the price per unit and $x$ is the number of units sold. Find the break-even points.

**Solution:**

1.  **Define the Cost Function:**
    $$C(x) = 2000 + 15x$$
2.  **Define the Revenue Function:**
    Revenue is price times quantity: $R(x) = p(x) \cdot x = (50 - 0.02x)x = 50x - 0.02x^2$
3.  **Set Up the Break-Even Equation:**
    $$R(x) = C(x)$$
    $$50x - 0.02x^2 = 2000 + 15x$$
4.  **Rearrange into Standard Quadratic Form:**
    $$-0.02x^2 + 50x - 15x - 2000 = 0$$
    $$-0.02x^2 + 35x - 2000 = 0$$
    Multiply by -50 to simplify:
    $$x^2 - 1750x + 100,000 = 0$$
5.  **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
    Use the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
    $$x = \frac{1750 \pm \sqrt{(-1750)^2 - 4(1)(100,000)}}{2(1)}$$
    $$x = \frac{1750 \pm \sqrt{3,062,500 - 400,000}}{2}$$
    $$x = \frac{1750 \pm \sqrt{2,662,500}}{2}$$
    $$x = \frac{1750 \pm 1631.72}{2}$$
    $$x_1 = \frac{1750 - 1631.72}{2} \approx 59.14$$
    $$x_2 = \frac{1750 + 1631.72}{2} \approx 1690.86$$

**Answer:** The break-even points are approximately 59 units and 1691 units. This means the business is profitable only when producing between roughly 59 and 1691 units per month.

# Chapter 4: Mastering Quadratics — Factoring, Completing the Square, and the Quadratic Formula

---

## 4.1 Introduction: Why Quadratics Matter

A quadratic expression is any expression of the form **ax² + bx + c**, where **a ≠ 0**, and **a**, **b**, and **c** are real numbers. The word "quadratic" comes from the Latin *quadratus*, meaning "square," because the highest-degree term involves x² — a variable multiplied by itself, just as a square has sides of equal length.

Quadratics appear everywhere in mathematics and its applications:

- **Projectile motion**: The height of a ball thrown into the air follows a quadratic function of time.
- **Area problems**: The area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter is a quadratic function of one side length.
- **Optimization**: Finding maximum profit, minimum cost, or maximum area all reduce to analyzing quadratic functions.
- **Physics**: Kinetic energy, gravitational potential energy, and many other physical quantities involve squared terms.
- **Engineering**: Parabolic reflectors, suspension bridges, and satellite dishes all rely on the geometric properties of parabolas.

On the SAT and ACT, quadratics are one of the most heavily tested topics. You will be asked to:

1. Factor quadratic expressions
2. Solve quadratic equations
3. Convert between different forms of a quadratic
4. Find the vertex, axis of symmetry, and intercepts
5. Interpret the discriminant
6. Model real-world situations with quadratics

This chapter will give you a complete, rigorous understanding of all these skills.

## 4.2 The Three Forms of a Quadratic

Every quadratic can be written in three equivalent forms, each of which reveals different information about the parabola.

### 4.2.1 Standard Form: y = ax² + bx + c

This is the most common form. The coefficients **a**, **b**, and **c** are real numbers with **a ≠ 0**.

**What it reveals:**
- The **y-intercept** is at **(0, c)**. This is the point where the parabola crosses the y-axis.
- The sign of **a** tells you whether the parabola opens **upward** (a > 0, a minimum exists) or **downward** (a < 0, a maximum exists).
- The **width** of the parabola is determined by |a|. Larger |a| means a narrower parabola; smaller |a| means a wider parabola.

**Example:** y = 2x² − 8x + 6
- a = 2 (opens upward, relatively narrow)
- b = −8
- c = 6 (y-intercept at (0, 6))

### 4.2.2 Vertex Form: y = a(x − h)² + k

This form directly reveals the **vertex** of the parabola, which is the point **(h, k)**.

**What it reveals:**
- The **vertex** is at **(h, k)**. This is the maximum or minimum point of the parabola.
- The **axis of symmetry** is the vertical line **x = h**.
- The value of **a** has the same meaning as in standard form.

**Example:** y = 2(x − 3)² + 5
- Vertex: (3, 5)
- Axis of symmetry: x = 3
- Opens upward (a = 2 > 0), so the vertex is a minimum.

**Important note on signs:** In the vertex form y = a(x − h)² + k, the x-coordinate of the vertex is **h**, which is the value that makes the squared term equal to zero. If you see y = a(x + m)² + k, rewrite it as y = a(x − (−m))² + k to see that h = −m.

### 4.2.3 Intercept Form (Factored Form): y = a(x − p)(x − q)

This form directly reveals the **x-intercepts** (also called **roots** or **zeros**) of the parabola.

**What it reveals:**
- The **x-intercepts** are at **(p, 0)** and **(q, 0)**.
- The axis of symmetry is halfway between the roots: **x = (p + q)/2**.
- The value of **a** determines the direction and width of the parabola.

**Example:** y = 3(x − 1)(x − 5)
- x-intercepts: (1, 0) and (5, 0)
- Axis of symmetry: x = (1 + 5)/2 = 3
- Vertex is at x = 3; substitute to find y: y = 3(3 − 1)(3 − 5) = 3(2)(−2) = −12, so vertex is (3, −12)

---

## 4.3 Converting Between Forms

### 4.3.1 Standard Form → Vertex Form: Completing the Square

This is one of the most important algebraic techniques you will learn. It allows you to rewrite any quadratic in standard form into vertex form.

**The Process:**

Given y = ax² + bx + c:

**Step 1:** Factor out **a** from the first two terms (if a ≠ 1):
y = a(x² + (b/a)x) + c

**Step 2:** Take half of the coefficient of x, square it, and add and subtract it inside the parentheses:
- Half of (b/a) is b/(2a)
- Squaring gives b²/(4a²)

y = a(x² + (b/a)x + b²/(4a²) − b²/(4a²)) + c

**Step 3:** Group the perfect trinomial square:
y = a[(x + b/(2a))² − b²/(4a²)] + c

**Step 4:** Distribute **a** and simplify:
y = a(x + b/(2a))² − ab²/(4a²) + c
y = a(x + b/(2a))² − b²/(4a) + c
y = a(x − h)² + k

where **h = −b/(2a)** and **k = c − b²/(4a)**

**Worked Example:**

Convert y = 2x² − 8x + 5 to vertex form.

Step 1: Factor out 2 from the first two terms:
y = 2(x² − 4x) + 5

Step 2: Half of −4 is −2. Squaring gives 4. Add and subtract 4 inside the parentheses:
y = 2(x² − 4x + 4 − 4) + 5
y = 2((x² − 4x + 4) − 4) + 5

Step 3: The trinomial is a perfect square:
y = 2((x − 2)² − 4) + 5

Step 4: Distribute the 2 and simplify:
y = 2(x − 2)² − 8 + 5
y = 2(x − 2)² − 3

**Vertex: (2, −3)**

**Verification:** Expand 2(x − 2)² − 3 = 2(x² − 4x + 4) − 3 = 2x² − 8x + 8 − 3 = 2x² − 8x + 5 ✓

### 4.3.2 Vertex Form → Standard Form: Expanding

This is straightforward — just expand the squared term and simplify.

**Worked Example:**

Convert y = −3(x + 1)² + 7 to standard form.

y = −3(x + 1)² + 7
y = −3(x² + 2x + 1) + 7
y = −3x² − 6x − 3 + 7
y = −3x² − 6x + 4

### 4.3.3 Standard Form → Intercept Form: Factoring

This requires factoring the quadratic expression. We will cover this in extensive detail in Section 4.4.

### 4.3.4 Intercept Form → Standard Form: Expanding

**Worked Example:**

Convert y = 2(x − 3)(x + 1) to standard form.

y = 2(x² + x − 3x − 3)
y = 2(x² − 2x − 3)
y = 2x² − 4x − 6

## 4.4 Factoring Quadratics

Factoring is the process of writing a quadratic expression as a product of two binomials. It is the key to finding x-intercepts and solving quadratic equations.

### 4.4.1 Factoring Out the GCF (Greatest Common Factor)

**Always check for a GCF first!** This is the single most common mistake students make — they forget to factor out the GCF before attempting other methods.

**Worked Example:**

Factor 6x² + 18x − 24.

Step 1: Identify the GCF of 6, 18, and 24. The GCF is 6.

Step 2: Factor out 6:
6(x² + 3x − 4)

Step 3: Factor the remaining trinomial:
6(x + 4)(x − 1)

**Worked Example:**

Factor −2x² + 10x − 12.

Step 1: The GCF is −2 (factoring out a negative makes the leading coefficient positive, which is easier to work with):

−2(x² − 5x + 6)

Step 2: Factor the trinomial:
−2(x − 2)(x − 3)

### 4.4.2 Factoring x² + bx + c (When a = 1)

When the leading coefficient is 1, factoring is relatively straightforward. We need to find two numbers **m** and **n** such that:

- m · n = c (the constant term)
- m + n = b (the coefficient of x)

Then: x² + bx + c = (x + m)(x + n)

**Worked Example:**

Factor x² + 7x + 12.

We need two numbers that multiply to 12 and add to 7.

Pairs that multiply to 12:
- 1 and 12 → 1 + 12 = 13 ✗
- 2 and 6 → 2 + 6 = 8 ✗
- 3 and 4 → 3 + 4 = 7 ✓

Therefore: x² + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)

**Worked Example:**

Factor x² − 5x − 14.

We need two numbers that multiply to −14 and add to −5.

Pairs that multiply to −14:
- 1 and −14 → 1 + (−14) = −13 ✗
- −1 and 14 → −1 + 14 = 13 ✗
- 2 and −7 → 2 + (−7) = −5 ✓

Therefore: x² − 5x − 14 = (x + 2)(x − 7)

**Worked Example:**

Factor x² − 9. (Difference of squares!)

x² − 9 = x² − 3² = (x + 3)(x − 3)

### 4.4.3 Factoring ax² + bx + c (When a ≠ 1): The AC Method

When the leading coefficient is not 1, factoring becomes more involved. The **AC Method** (also called the "grouping method" or "split the middle term" method) is the most reliable approach.

**The AC Method:**

Given ax² + bx + c:

**Step 1:** Multiply **a · c**.

**Step 2:** Find two numbers **m** and **n** such that:
- m · n = a · c
- m + n = b

**Step 3:** Rewrite the middle term bx as mx + nx.

**Step 4:** Factor by grouping.

**Worked Example:**

Factor 6x² + 17x + 5.

Step 1: a · c = 6 · 5 = 30

Step 2: Find two numbers that multiply to 30 and add to 17.
- 1 and 30 → 1 + 30 = 31 ✗
- 2 and 15 → 2 + 15 = 17 ✓

Step 3: Rewrite 17x as 2x + 15x:
6x² + 2x + 15x + 5

Step 4: Factor by grouping:
(6x² + 2x) + (15x + 5)
2x(3x + 1) + 5(3x + 1)
(3x + 1)(2x + 5)

**Verification:** (3x + 1)(2x + 5) = 6x² + 15x + 2x + 5 = 6x² + 17x + 5 ✓

**Worked Example:**

Factor 4x² − 4x − 15.

Step 1: a · c = 4 · (−15) = −60

Step 2: Find two numbers that multiply to −60 and add to −4.
- 6 and −10 → 6 + (−10) = −4 ✓ (and 6 · (−10) = −60 ✓)

Step 3: Rewrite −4x as 6x − 10x:
4x² + 6x − 10x − 15

Step 4: Factor by grouping:
(4x² + 6x) + (−10x − 15)
2x(2x + 3) − 5(2x + 3)
(2x + 3)(2x − 5)

**Verification:** (2x + 3)(2x − 5) = 4x² − 10x + 6x − 15 = 4x² − 4x − 15 ✓

**Worked Example:**

Factor 10x² + 17x + 3.

Step 1: a · c = 10 · 3 = 30

Step 2: Find two numbers that multiply to 30 and add to 17.
- 2 and 15 → 2 + 15 = 17 ✓

Step 3: Rewrite 17x as 2x + 15x:
10x² + 2x + 15x + 3

Step 4: Factor by grouping:
(10x² + 2x) + (15x + 3)
2x(5x + 1) + 3(5x + 1)
(5x + 1)(2x + 3)

### 4.4.4 Special Factoring Patterns

**Difference of Squares:**
a² − b² = (a + b)(a − b)

**Worked Example:**
25x² − 49 = (5x)² − 7² = (5x + 7)(5x − 7)

**Worked Example:**
4x² − 9y² = (2x)² − (3y)² = (2x + 3y)(2x − 3y)

**Perfect Square Trinomials:**
a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)²
a² − 2ab + b² = (a − b)²

**Worked Example:**
x² + 10x + 25 = x² + 2(x)(5) + 5² = (x + 5)²

**Worked Example:**
4x² − 12x + 9 = (2x)² − 2(2x)(3) + 3² = (2x − 3)²

**Sum/Difference of Cubes:**
a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² − ab + b²)
a³ − b³ = (a − b)(a² + ab + b²)

**Worked Example:**
8x³ − 125 = (2x)³ − 5³ = (2x − 5)(4x² + 10x + 25)

---

## 4.5 Solving Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation is an equation of the form **ax² + bx + c = 0**. There are four main methods for solving them.

### 4.5.1 Method 1: Factoring (Zero Product Property)

**The Zero Product Property:** If A · B = 0, then A = 0 or B = 0 (or both).

**Process:**
1. Set the equation equal to zero.
2. Factor the quadratic expression completely.
3. Set each factor equal to zero.
4. Solve each resulting linear equation.

**Worked Example:**

Solve 2x² − 5x − 3 = 0.

Step 1: The equation is already set to zero.

Step 2: Factor. a · c = 2 · (−3) = −6. We need two numbers that multiply to −6 and add to −5.
- −6 and 1 → −6 + 1 = −5 ✓

2x² − 6x + x − 3 = 0
(2x² − 6x) + (x − 3) = 0
2x(x − 3) + 1(x − 3) = 0
(x − 3)(2x + 1) = 0

Step 3: Set each factor to zero:
x − 3 = 0 → x = 3
2x + 1 = 0 → x = −1/2

**Solutions: x = 3 and x = −1/2**

**Worked Example:**

Solve x² − 9 = 0.

This is a difference of squares:
(x + 3)(x − 3) = 0

x + 3 = 0 → x = −3
x − 3 = 0 → x = 3

**Solutions: x = −3 and x = 3**

### 4.5.2 Method 2: Square Root Method

This method works when the equation has the form **(expression)² = k**.

**Process:**
1. Isolate the squared expression.
2. Take the square root of both sides (remember ±).
3. Solve for x.

**Worked Example:**

Solve (x − 3)² = 25.

Step 1: The squared expression is already isolated.

Step 2: Take the square root of both sides:
x − 3 = ±5

Step 3: Solve:
x − 3 = 5 → x = 8
x − 3 = −5 → x = −2

**Solutions: x = 8 and x = −2**

**Worked Example:**

Solve 2(x + 1)² = 18.

Step 1: Divide both sides by 2:
(x + 1)² = 9

Step 2: Take the square root:
x + 1 = ±3

Step 3: Solve:
x + 1 = 3 → x = 2
x + 1 = −3 → x = −4

**Solutions: x = 2 and x = −4**

### 4.5.3 Method 3: Completing the Square

This method works for any quadratic equation and is the basis for deriving the quadratic formula.

**Process:**
1. Move the constant to the right side.
2. If a ≠ 1, divide everything by a.
3. Take half of the coefficient of x, square it, and add to both sides.
4. Write the left side as a perfect square.
5. Use the square root method.

**Worked Example:**

Solve x² − 6x + 2 = 0 by completing the square.

Step 1: Move the constant:
x² − 6x = −2

Step 2: a = 1, so no division needed.

Step 3: Half of −6 is −3. Squaring gives 9. Add 9 to both sides:
x² − 6x + 9 = −2 + 9
(x − 3)² = 7

Step 4: Take the square root:
x − 3 = ±√7

Step 5: Solve:
x = 3 ± √7

**Solutions: x = 3 + √7 and x = 3 − √7**

**Worked Example:**

Solve 3x² + 12x − 15 = 0 by completing the square.

Step 1: Move the constant:
3x² + 12x = 15

Step 2: Divide by 3:
x² + 4x = 5

Step 3: Half of 4 is 2. Squaring gives 4. Add 4 to both sides:
x² + 4x + 4 = 5 + 4
(x + 2)² = 9

Step 4: Take the square root:
x + 2 = ±3

Step 5: Solve:
x + 2 = 3 → x = 1
x + 2 = −3 → x = −5

**Solutions: x = 1 and x = −5**

### 4.5.4 Method 4: The Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula solves **any** quadratic equation. It is derived by completing the square on the general form ax² + bx + c = 0.

**Derivation:**

Starting with ax² + bx + c = 0:

Step 1: Divide by a:
x² + (b/a)x + c/a = 0

Step 2: Move the constant:
x² + (b/a)x = −c/a

Step 3: Complete the square. Half of b/a is b/(2a). Squaring gives b²/(4a²).
x² + (b/a)x + b²/(4a²) = −c/a + b²/(4a²)

Step 4: Write as a perfect square:
(x + b/(2a))² = −c/a + b²/(4a²)

Step 5: Combine the right side with a common denominator of 4a²:
(x + b/(2a))² = (b² − 4ac)/(4a²)

Step 6: Take the square root:
x + b/(2a) = ±√(b² − 4ac)/(2a)

Step 7: Solve for x:
x = −b/(2a) ± √(b² − 4ac)/(2a)

**The Quadratic Formula:**

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

**Worked Example:**

Solve 2x² − 5x − 3 = 0 using the quadratic formula.

Identify: a = 2, b = −5, c = −3

$$x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(2)(-3)}}{2(2)}$$

$$x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 24}}{4}$$

$$x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{49}}{4}$$

$$x = \frac{5 \pm 7}{4}$$

$$x = \frac{5 + 7}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3$$

$$x = \frac{5 - 7}{4} = \frac{-2}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}$$

**Solutions: x = 3 and x = −1/2** ✓ (matches our factoring result)

**Worked Example:**

Solve x² − 6x + 2 = 0 using the quadratic formula.

Identify: a = 1, b = −6, c = 2

$$x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)}$$

$$x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 8}}{2}$$

$$x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{28}}{2}$$

$$x = \frac{6 \pm 2\sqrt{7}}{2}$$

$$x = 3 \pm \sqrt{7}$$

**Solutions: x = 3 + √7 and x = 3 − √7** ✓ (matches our completing the square result)

## 4.6 The Discriminant: Predicting the Nature of Solutions

The expression under the square root in the quadratic formula, **b² − 4ac**, is called the **discriminant**. It tells us the number and type of solutions without actually solving the equation.

### 4.6.1 The Three Cases

**Case 1: b² − 4ac > 0 (Positive Discriminant)**

The square root of a positive number is a real number. Since we have ±√(positive), we get **two distinct real solutions**.

If the discriminant is a **perfect square**, the solutions are **rational** numbers (and the quadratic factors over the integers).

If the discriminant is **not** a perfect square, the solutions are **irrational** (involving a square root).

**Worked Example:**

For 2x² − 5x − 3 = 0: a = 2, b = −5, c = −3

Discriminant = (−5)² − 4(2)(−3) = 25 + 24 = 49

49 > 0 and 49 = 7² is a perfect square → **two distinct rational solutions**

**Worked Example:**

For x² − 6x + 2 = 0: a = 1, b = −6, c = 2

Discriminant = (−6)² − 4(1)(2) = 36 − 8 = 28

28 > 0 but 28 is not a perfect square → **two distinct irrational solutions**

**Case 2: b² − 4ac = 0 (Zero Discriminant)**

The square root of 0 is 0. The formula gives x = −b/(2a) only (the ±0 doesn't create a second value). We get **exactly one real solution** (called a **repeated root** or **double root**).

This occurs when the quadratic is a **perfect square trinomial**.

**Worked Example:**

For x² − 6x + 9 = 0: a = 1, b = −6, c = 9

Discriminant = (−6)² − 4(1)(9) = 36 − 36 = 0

**One repeated real solution:** x = 6/2 = 3

Indeed: x² − 6x + 9 = (x − 3)² = 0 → x = 3 (double root)

**Case 3: b² − 4ac < 0 (Negative Discriminant)**

The square root of a negative number is not a real number. We get **no real solutions** (the two solutions are complex conjugates).

**Worked Example:**

For x² + x + 5 = 0: a = 1, b = 1, c = 5

Discriminant = (1)² − 4(1)(5) = 1 − 20 = −19

−19 < 0 → **no real solutions**

### 4.6.2 Summary Table

| Discriminant (b² − 4ac) | Number of Real Solutions | Type of Solutions | Graph Crosses x-axis? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Positive, perfect square | 2 | Rational | Yes, at two rational points |
| Positive, not perfect square | 2 | Irrational | Yes, at two irrational points |
| Zero | 1 (repeated) | Rational | Yes, at exactly one point (vertex touches x-axis) |
| Negative | 0 | Complex (non-real) | No, parabola doesn't touch x-axis |

### 4.6.3 SAT/ACT Tip: Using the Discriminant

On the SAT and ACT, you may be asked questions like:

*"How many real solutions does the equation 3x² − 2x + 5 = 0 have?"*

Simply compute the discriminant:
b² − 4ac = (−2)² − 4(3)(5) = 4 − 60 = −56 < 0

**Answer: 0 real solutions**

---

## 4.7 The Vertex and Axis of Symmetry

### 4.7.1 Finding the Vertex

For a quadratic in standard form y = ax² + bx + c, the **x-coordinate of the vertex** is:

$$x_v = \frac{-b}{2a}$$

The **y-coordinate** is found by substituting x_v back into the original equation:

$$y_v = a\left(\frac{-b}{2a}\right)^2 + b\left(\frac{-b}{2a}\right) + c$$

Or more simply: y_v = f(−b/(2a))

**Worked Example:**

Find the vertex of y = 2x² − 8x + 5.

$$x_v = \frac{-(-8)}{2(2)} = \frac{8}{4} = 2$$

y_v = 2(2)² − 8(2) + 5 = 8 − 16 + 5 = −3

**Vertex: (2, −3)** ✓ (matches our completing the square result)

### 4.7.2 The Axis of Symmetry

The axis of symmetry is the vertical line through the vertex:

$$x = \frac{-b}{2a}$$

This line divides the parabola into two mirror-image halves.

### 4.7.3 Maximum or Minimum Value

- If **a > 0**: The parabola opens upward. The vertex is the **minimum point**. The minimum value of the function is **k** (the y-coordinate of the vertex).
- If **a < 0**: The parabola opens downward. The vertex is the **maximum point**. The maximum value of the function is **k**.

**Worked Example:**

Find the maximum value of y = −3x² + 12x − 7.

$$x_v = \frac{-12}{2(-3)} = \frac{-12}{-6} = 2$$

y_v = −3(2)² + 12(2) − 7 = −12 + 24 − 7 = 5

Since a = −3 < 0, the parabola opens downward, and the **maximum value is 5** (occurring at x = 2).

---

## 4.8 Finding the x-Intercepts and y-Intercept

### 4.8.1 Finding x-Intercepts (Roots/Zeros)

The x-intercepts occur where y = 0. Set the quadratic equal to zero and solve:

ax² + bx + c = 0

Use any of the four methods: factoring, square root method, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.

**Worked Example:**

Find the x-intercepts of y = x² − 5x + 6.

Set y = 0: x² − 5x + 6 = 0

Factor: (x − 2)(x − 3) = 0

x = 2 or x = 3

**x-intercepts: (2, 0) and (3, 0)**

### 4.8.2 Finding the y-Intercept

The y-intercept occurs where x = 0. Simply substitute x = 0 into the equation:

y = a(0)² + b(0) + c = c

**y-intercept: (0, c)**

**Worked Example:**

For y = 2x² − 5x − 3, the y-intercept is (0, −3).

---

## 4.9 The Sum and Product of Roots

For the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 with roots r₁ and r₂:

**Sum of roots:** r₁ + r₂ = −b/a

**Product of roots:** r₁ · r₂ = c/a

These relationships are known as **Vieta's Formulas** and are extremely useful on the SAT and ACT.

**Worked Example:**

For 3x² − 7x + 2 = 0:

Sum of roots = −(−7)/3 = 7/3

Product of roots = 2/3

**Verification by solving:**

Using the quadratic formula:

$$x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 24}}{6} = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{25}}{6} = \frac{7 \pm 5}{6}$$

x = 12/6 = 2 or x = 2/6 = 1/3

Sum: 2 + 1/3 = 7/3 ✓

Product: 2 · 1/3 = 2/3 ✓

### 4.9.1 Writing a Quadratic Given Its Roots

If you know the roots r₁ and r₂, you can write the quadratic as:

y = a(x − r₁)(x − r₂)

where a is any nonzero constant. If a = 1, you get the **monic** quadratic (leading coefficient 1).

**Worked Example:**

Write a quadratic with roots 3 and −2.

y = (x − 3)(x + 2)
y = x² + 2x − 3x − 6
y = x² − x − 6

**Worked Example:**

Write a quadratic with roots 1/2 and −4.

y = (x − 1/2)(x + 4)
y = x² + 4x − (1/2)x − 2
y = x² + (7/2)x − 2

To eliminate fractions, multiply by 2:
2y = 2x² + 7x − 4

Or equivalently: y = x² + (7/2)x − 2 (with a = 1) or 2x² + 7x − 4 = 0 (with integer coefficients).

## 4.10 Graphing Quadratics: A Complete Guide

### 4.10.1 Key Features of a Parabola

To graph a quadratic, identify these features:

1. **Direction of opening**: Up if a > 0, down if a < 0
2. **Vertex**: (h, k) — the maximum or minimum point
3. **Axis of symmetry**: x = h
4. **y-intercept**: (0, c)
5. **x-intercepts**: Found by solving ax² + bx + c = 0

### 4.10.2 Step-by-Step Graphing Process

**Worked Example:**

Graph y = −x² + 4x + 5.

**Step 1:** Direction. a = −1 < 0, so the parabola opens **downward**.

**Step 2:** Vertex.
$$x_v = \frac{-4}{2(-1)} = \frac{-4}{-2} = 2$$
y_v = −(2)² + 4(2) + 5 = −4 + 8 + 5 = 9
**Vertex: (2, 9)**

**Step 3:** Axis of symmetry: x = 2

**Step 4:** y-intercept. Set x = 0: y = 5. Point: **(0, 5)**

**Step 5:** x-intercepts. Set y = 0:
−x² + 4x + 5 = 0
x² − 4x − 5 = 0 (multiply both sides by −1)
(x − 5)(x + 1) = 0
x = 5 or x = −1
**x-intercepts: (5, 0) and (−1, 0)**

**Step 6:** Plot the vertex, intercepts, and use symmetry to find additional points. The axis of symmetry x = 2 means that for every point on one side, there's a mirror point on the other side. For example, the y-intercept (0, 5) is 2 units left of the axis, so there's a corresponding point 2 units right: (4, 5).

**Step 7:** Draw a smooth curve through all the points.

### 4.10.3 Domain and Range

For any quadratic function:

- **Domain:** All real numbers (−∞, +∞). You can substitute any real number for x.
- **Range:** Depends on the vertex and direction of opening.
  - If a > 0: Range is [k, +∞) where k is the y-coordinate of the vertex.
  - If a < 0: Range is (−∞, k] where k is the y-coordinate of the vertex.

**Worked Example:**

For y = −x² + 4x + 5, the vertex is (2, 9) and a < 0.

**Range: (−∞, 9]**

## 4.11 Quadratic Inequalities

### 4.11.1 Solving Quadratic Inequalities

**Process:**
1. Move all terms to one side: ax² + bx + c < 0 (or > 0, ≤ 0, ≥ 0)
2. Find the roots of the corresponding equation ax² + bx + c = 0
3. The roots divide the number line into intervals
4. Test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality is satisfied

**Worked Example:**

Solve x² − 5x + 6 > 0.

Step 1: Find the roots of x² − 5x + 6 = 0:
(x − 2)(x − 3) = 0
x = 2 or x = 3

Step 2: The roots divide the number line into three intervals:
(−∞, 2), (2, 3), (3, +∞)

Step 3: Test each interval:
- For x = 0 (in (−∞, 2)): 0² − 5(0) + 6 = 6 > 0 ✓
- For x = 2.5 (in (2, 3)): 6.25 − 12.5 + 6 = −0.25 < 0 ✗
- For x = 4 (in (3, +∞)): 16 − 20 + 6 = 2 > 0 ✓

**Solution: x < 2 or x > 3**, i.e., (−∞, 2) ∪ (3, +∞)

**Graphical interpretation:** The parabola y = x² − 5x + 6 opens upward and crosses the x-axis at x = 2 and x = 3. The function is positive (above the x-axis) when x < 2 or x > 3.

---

## 4.12 Advanced Topics

### 4.12.1 The Factor Theorem

**Factor Theorem:** (x − r) is a factor of a polynomial f(x) if and only if f(r) = 0.

This is useful for factoring higher-degree polynomials, but it also applies to quadratics.

**Worked Example:**

Show that (x − 3) is a factor of f(x) = x² − 5x + 6.

f(3) = 9 − 15 + 6 = 0 ✓

Therefore, (x − 3) is a factor. Dividing: x² − 5x + 6 = (x − 3)(x − 2).

### 4.12.2 Quadratic Systems

Sometimes you need to find the intersection points of a quadratic and a line (or two quadratics). This requires solving a system of equations.

**Worked Example:**

Find the points of intersection of y = x² − 4x + 3 and y = x − 1.

Set the right sides equal:
x² − 4x + 3 = x − 1
x² − 5x + 4 = 0
(x − 1)(x − 4) = 0
x = 1 or x = 4

Find the corresponding y-values:
- When x = 1: y = 1 − 1 = 0
- When x = 4: y = 4 − 1 = 3

**Points of intersection: (1, 0) and (4, 3)**

### 4.12.3 Transformations of Quadratics

Starting from the parent function y = x², we can obtain any quadratic through transformations:

- **y = x² + k**: Vertical shift by k units (up if k > 0, down if k < 0)
- **y = (x − h)²**: Horizontal shift by h units (right if h > 0, left if h < 0)
- **y = a(x − h)² + k**: Combined transformations
  - |a| > 1: Vertical stretch (narrower)
  - 0 < |a| < 1: Vertical compression (wider)
  - a < 0: Reflection across x-axis

**Worked Example:**

Describe the transformations from y = x² to y = −2(x + 3)² + 4.

1. Horizontal shift left 3 units: y = (x + 3)²
2. Vertical stretch by factor of 2: y = 2(x + 3)²
3. Reflection across x-axis: y = −2(x + 3)²
4. Vertical shift up 4 units: y = −2(x + 3)² + 4

### Problem Set 3: Applications

**Problem 7:** A ball is thrown upward from a height of 5 feet with an initial velocity of 48 feet per second. The height h (in feet) after t seconds is given by h = −16t² + 48t + 5. What is the maximum height reached by the ball, and when does it occur?

*Solution:*
The maximum height occurs at the vertex.

$$t_v = \frac{-48}{2(-16)} = \frac{-48}{-32} = 1.5 \text{ seconds}$$

18 − 15 + k = 0
k = −3

Now the equation is 2x² − 5x − 3 = 0.

Using the product of roots: r₁ · r₂ = c/a = −3/2
3 · r₂ = −3/2
r₂ = −1/2

**Answer: k = −3, other root = −1/2**

**Verification:** 2x² − 5x − 3 = (x − 3)(2x + 1) = 0 → x = 3 or x = −1/2 ✓

## 4.15 Final Tips for the SAT and ACT

1. **Always check for a GCF first** before attempting to factor.

2. **Memorize the quadratic formula.** It solves every quadratic equation, even when factoring is difficult or impossible.

3. **Know the discriminant cold.** Questions about the number of solutions appear frequently.

4. **Use Vieta's formulas** (sum and product of roots) to save time on problems that ask about relationships between roots.

5. **When in doubt, use the quadratic formula.** It always works, even if factoring would be faster.

6. **For "find the vertex" problems**, use x = −b/(2a) and then substitute. Don't waste time completing the square unless specifically asked.

7. **Check your answers** by substituting back into the original equation.

8. **On multiple choice**, you can often eliminate wrong answers by checking the discriminant or testing values.

9. **For word problems**, define your variables clearly, set up the equation, and remember that the solution must make sense in context (e.g., negative time or negative length is usually not valid).

10. **Practice converting between forms.** The SAT and ACT frequently ask you to identify the vertex from standard form, or to find intercepts from vertex form.

## 5.1 Ratios: The Foundation of Proportional Reasoning

A **ratio** is a comparison of two or more quantities by division. It expresses how much of one thing exists relative to another. Ratios can be written in three equivalent forms:

- **Colon notation:** $a:b$
- **Fraction notation:** $\dfrac{a}{b}$
- **Word notation:** $a \text{ to } b$

### Simplification of Ratios

Every ratio must be expressed in **simplest form** (lowest terms). This means dividing both terms by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

**Example 5.1:** Simplify the ratio $24:36$.

The GCD of 24 and 36 is 12. Dividing both terms:
$$24:36 = \frac{24}{12} : \frac{36}{12} = 2:3$$

### The Hidden Problem With Ratios

A critical insight students must internalize: **ratios do NOT give you exact values.** If the ratio of boys to girls is $2:3$, you know there are $2m$ boys and $3g$ girls for some positive multiplier $m$, but you cannot determine the actual number of boys or girls without additional information.

**Using the Unknown Multiplier ($m$):**

When a ratio $a:b$ is given, assign:
- First quantity $= am$
- Second quantity $= bm$
- Total $= (a + b)m$

The unknown multiplier $m$ can be resolved when the total, the difference, or one specific quantity is provided.

**Example 5.2:** The ratio of boys to girls in a class is $2:3$. If there are 35 students total, how many boys are there?

Let the number of boys $= 2m$ and the number of girls $= 3m$.
$$2m + 3m = 35$$
$$5m = 35$$
$$m = 7$$

Therefore, the number of boys is $2m = 2(7) = \boxed{14}$.

### Extended Ratios (Three or More Parts)

Ratios can compare three or more quantities simultaneously, written as $a:b:c$.

**Example 5.3:** The sides of a triangle are in the ratio $3:4:5$. If the perimeter is 72 cm, find each side.

Let the sides be $3m$, $4m$, and $5m$.
$$3m + 4m + 5m = 72$$
$$12m = 72$$
$$m = 6$$

The sides are $3(6) = 18$ cm, $4(6) = 24$ cm, and $5(6) = 30$ cm.

### SAT/ACT Trap: Part-to-Part vs. Part-to-Whole

One of the most common errors on standardized tests involves confusing a **part-to-part** ratio with a **part-to-whole** ratio.

**Example 5.4:** The ratio of red marbles to blue marbles in a bag is $3:5$. What fraction of all marbles are blue?

The ratio given is **part-to-part** (red to blue). To find the fraction that are blue, we need **part-to-whole**.

If red:blue $= 3:5$, then:
- Red $= 3$ parts
- Blue $= 5$ parts
- Whole $= 3 + 5 = 8$ parts

Fraction that are blue $= \dfrac{5}{8}$.

---

## 5.2 Rates: Quantities With Units

A **rate** is a special type of ratio that compares two quantities with **different units**. The word "per" is the key indicator.

### Definition and Formula

$$\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Quantity}_1}{\text{Quantity}_2} = \frac{\text{Quantity}_1 \text{ unit}_1}{\text{Quantity}_2 \text{ unit}_2}$$

Common rates include:
| Rate Type | Formula | Units |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Speed | $\dfrac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}$ | mph, m/s |
| Density | $\dfrac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}$ | g/cm³ |
| Unit Price | $\dfrac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Items}}$ | $/item |
| Rate of Change | $\dfrac{\text{Change in } y}{\text{Change in } x}$ | various |

### Speed: The Fundamental Rate

**Average Speed** is defined as:

$$\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}$$

**Critical Warning:** The average of two speeds is NOT the average speed. If you travel 60 mph for the first half of a trip and 40 mph for the second half, your average speed is **not** 50 mph.

**Example 5.5:** A car travels from City A to City B at 60 mph and returns from City B to City A at 40 mph. What is the average speed for the entire round trip?

Let the one-way distance be $d$ miles. Total distance $= 2d$.

Time going $= \dfrac{d}{60}$ hours.

Time returning $= \dfrac{d}{40}$ hours.

Total time $= \dfrac{d}{60} + \dfrac{d}{40} = d\left(\dfrac{1}{60} + \dfrac{1}{40}\right) = d\left(\dfrac{2+3}{120}\right) = \dfrac{5d}{120} = \dfrac{d}{24}$

$$\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2d}{\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \times \frac{24}{d} = 48 \text{ mph}$$

This result illustrates the **harmonic mean** principle: when equal distances are traveled at two different speeds $r_1$ and $r_2$, the average speed is:

$$\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2r_1 r_2}{r_1 + r_2}$$

### The Chart Method for Rate Problems

When problems involve two or more different rates, organize information in a chart:

| | Quantity | Rate | Consumption |
|---|----------|------|-------------|
| Trip 1 | $d_1$ | $r_1$ | $c_1$ |
| Trip 2 | $d_2$ | $r_2$ | $c_2$ |

**Example 5.6:** Ashish drives to AHA Academy at 40 mph and returns home along the same route at 60 mph. What is his average speed for the entire round trip?

This is identical to Example 5.5:

$$\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2(40)(60)}{40 + 60} = \frac{4800}{100} = 48 \text{ mph}$$

Note that the answer is always closer to the slower speed. This is because more time is spent at the slower speed.

---

## 5.3 Proportions: Setting Up and Solving Equations

A **proportion** is an equation stating that two ratios are equal.

$$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$$

### Cross-Multiplication

The fundamental technique for solving proportions:

$$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad ad = bc$$

This works because multiplying both sides by $bd$ gives $ad = bc$.

**Example 5.7:** Solve for $x$: $\dfrac{3}{7} = \dfrac{x}{35}$

Cross-multiplying:
$$3 \times 35 = 7 \times x$$
$$105 = 7x$$
$$x = 15$$

### Direct Proportionality

Two quantities $y$ and $x$ are **directly proportional** if their ratio is constant:

$$\frac{y}{x} = k \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad y = kx$$

where $k$ is the **constant of proportionality**.

When two quantities are directly proportional, increasing one by a certain factor causes the other to increase by the same factor.

**Example 5.8:** If 8 apples cost $12, how many apples can be bought for $30?

Setting up a proportion (maintaining consistent order):
$$\frac{8 \text{ apples}}{12 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{n \text{ apples}}{30 \text{ dollars}}$$

$$8 \times 30 = 12 \times n$$
$$240 = 12n$$
$$n = 20 \text{ apples}$$

**Alternative (Unit Rate) Method:**
Cost per apple $= \dfrac{12}{8} = \$1.50$ per apple.
Number of apples for $\$30 = \dfrac{30}{1.50} = 20$ apples.

### Inverse Proportionality

Two quantities $y$ and $x$ are **inversely proportional** if their product is constant:

$$xy = k \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad y = \frac{k}{x}$$

When two quantities are inversely proportional, increasing one by a certain factor causes the other to decrease by the same factor.

**Example 5.9:** If 5 workers can complete a job in 12 days, how many days will it take 8 workers?

The total work is constant: $5 \times 12 = 60$ worker-days.

With 8 workers: $8 \times d = 60$, so $d = 7.5$ days.

---

## 5.4 Factor-of-Change (Scaling) Approach

When a problem tells you how certain quantities change (by a given percent or factor) and asks how a related quantity changes, the **factor-of-change** method is often the most powerful approach.

### The General Framework

Start with a known formula. Eliminate constants. Replace each variable with its **factor of change** (how much it scales by). Solve for the unknown factor of change.

### Area Scaling

If a linear dimension (radius, side length, height) is scaled by a factor of $r$, then:

- **Perimeter** scales by factor $r$
- **Area** scales by factor $r^2$
- **Volume** scales by factor $r^3$

**Example 5.10:** If the radius of a circle is increased by 25%, by what percent does the area change?

Area formula: $A = \pi r^2$

The factor of change for $r$: $1 + 0.25 = 1.25$

The factor of change for $A$: $(1.25)^2 = 1.5625$

Percent change: $(1.5625 - 1) \times 100\% = \boxed{56.25\%}$ increase.

### Volume and Density Applications

**Example 5.11:** An object's mass is decreased by 20% and its speed is increased by 20%. By what factor does its kinetic energy change?

Kinetic energy formula: $KE = \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2$

Eliminate the constant $\dfrac{1}{2}$: $KE \sim mv^2$

Factor of change for $m$: $1 - 0.20 = 0.80$
Factor of change for $v^2$: $(1.20)^2 = 1.44$

Factor of change for $KE$: $0.80 \times 1.44 = 1.152$

$$\boxed{KE \text{ increases by } 15.2\%}$$

**Critical Insight:** Notice that this answer is **not** "no change at all." A 20% decrease in mass and a 20% increase in speed do NOT cancel out because speed is **squared** in the kinetic energy formula. This is a classic SAT trap answer.

### General Formula for Percent Change Using Factors

If a quantity $Q$ depends on variables as $Q = k \cdot x^a \cdot y^b \cdot z^c$, and:
- $x$ changes by $p\%$,
- $y$ changes by $q\%$,
- $z$ changes by $r\%$,

then $Q$ changes by a factor of:
$$(1 + \tfrac{p}{100})^a \cdot (1 + \tfrac{q}{100})^b \cdot (1 + \tfrac{r}{100})^c$$

The percent change in $Q$ is:
$$\left[(1 + \tfrac{p}{100})^a \cdot (1 + \tfrac{q}{100})^b \cdot (1 + \tfrac{r}{100})^c - 1\right] \times 100\%$$

**Example 5.12:** The area of a rectangle is given by $A = lw$. If the length is increased by 30% and the width is decreased by 10%, what is the percent change in area?

Factor: $(1.30)(0.90) = 1.17$

Percent change: $(1.17 - 1) \times 100\% = \boxed{17\% \text{ increase}}$

---

## 5.5 Advanced Proportion Problems

### Shadow Problems (Similar Triangles)

When two objects cast shadows at the same time and place, the triangles formed are similar, so corresponding sides are proportional.

**Example 5.13:** A 6-foot-tall man casts a 4-foot shadow. At the same time, a tree casts a 30-foot shadow. How tall is the tree?

$$\frac{\text{man's height}}{\text{man's shadow}} = \frac{\text{tree's height}}{\text{tree's shadow}}$$

$$\frac{6}{4} = \frac{h}{30}$$

$$4h = 180$$

$$h = 45 \text{ feet}$$

### Mixture Problems

**Example 5.14:** How many liters of a 25% acidic solution must be added to 40 liters of a 40% acidic solution to make a solution that is 30% acidic?

Let $x$ = liters of 25% solution.

Using the equation: (acid from mix 1) + (acid from mix 2) = (acid from final mix)

$$0.25x + 0.40(40) = 0.30(x + 40)$$
$$0.25x + 16 = 0.30x + 12$$
$$16 - 12 = 0.30x - 0.25x$$
$$4 = 0.05x$$
$$x = \boxed{80 \text{ liters}}$$

### "Old" vs. "New" Problems Using Factors

**Example 5.15:** If Ashish is 250% older than Bob, then Bob is what percent younger than Ashish?

Let Bob's age $= x$.

"Ashish is 250% older than Bob" means Ashish's age equals Bob's age **plus** 250% of Bob's age:
$$\text{Ashish} = x + 2.5x = 3.5x$$

Now, how much younger is Bob than Ashish?
$$\text{Difference} = 3.5x - x = 2.5x$$

Bob's age as a percentage **less than** Ashish's age:
$$\frac{2.5x}{3.5x} \times 100\% = \frac{2.5}{3.5} \times 100\% = \frac{5}{7} \times 100\% = 71\frac{3}{7}\%$$

**Critical Distinction:** "250% older" does NOT mean "250% as old." The word "older" signals addition to the original 100%. This is one of the most commonly tested misconceptions on the SAT.

To further clarify: If A is $p\%$ older than B, then:
$$A = B + \frac{p}{100} \cdot B = B\left(1 + \frac{p}{100}\right)$$

To find what percent younger B is than A:
$$\frac{A - B}{A} \times 100\% = \frac{\frac{p}{100}}{1 + \frac{p}{100}} \times 100\% = \frac{p}{100 + p} \times 100\%$$

---

## 5.6 Rates in Context: Work Problems

### The Work-Rate Formula

For any job, define the **rate of work** as:
$$\text{Rate} = \frac{1 \text{ job}}{t \text{ time units}} = \frac{1}{t}$$

When multiple workers collaborate:
$$\text{Combined Rate} = \text{Rate}_1 + \text{Rate}_2 + \cdots$$

The time to complete one job working together:
$$\text{Time Together} = \frac{1}{\text{Combined Rate}}$$

**Example 5.16:** Pipe A can fill a tank in 6 hours. Pipe B can fill the same tank in 4 hours. How long will it take to fill the tank if both pipes are opened simultaneously?

Rate of Pipe A $= \dfrac{1}{6}$ tank per hour
Rate of Pipe B $= \dfrac{1}{4}$ tank per hour

Combined rate $= \dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{1}{4} = \dfrac{5}{12}$ tank per hour

Time $= \dfrac{1}{\frac{5}{12}} = \dfrac{12}{5} = \boxed{2.4 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours } 24 \text{ minutes}}$

**Example 5.17:** A cold water faucet can fill a sink in 8 minutes. A hot water faucet can fill the same sink in 12 minutes. A drain can empty the full sink in 24 minutes. If all three are open simultaneously, how long does it take to fill the sink?

Rate of cold tap $= \dfrac{1}{8}$
Rate of hot tap $= \dfrac{1}{12}$
Rate of drain $= -\dfrac{1}{24}$ (negative because it empties)

Net rate $= \dfrac{1}{8} + \dfrac{1}{12} - \dfrac{1}{24} = \dfrac{3+2-1}{24} = \dfrac{4}{24} = \dfrac{1}{6}$

Time $= \boxed{6 \text{ minutes}}$

## 5.7 Challenging Practice Problems with Solutions

### Problem 1 (Ratios with Change)

The ratio of Alice's money to Bob's money is $5:3$. After Alice gives Bob $\$10$, their money is in the ratio $7:5$. How much money did Alice originally have?

**Solution:** Let Alice have $5m$ and Bob have $3m$. After the transfer:
$$\frac{5m - 10}{3m + 10} = \frac{7}{5}$$
$$5(5m - 10) = 7(3m + 10)$$
$$25m - 50 = 21m + 70$$
$$4m = 120$$
$$m = 30$$

Alice originally had $5m = 5(30) = \boxed{\$150}$.

### Problem 2 (Rates with Relative Motion)

Two runners start from the same point on a circular track. Runner A runs at 8 mph and Runner B runs at 6 mph, both in the same direction. How long will it take A to first lap B if the track is 1 mile around?

**Solution:** The relative speed of A with respect to B $= 8 - 6 = 2$ mph.

To gain a full lap (1 mile) on B:
$$\text{Time} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2 \text{ mph}} = \boxed{0.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ minutes}}$$

### Problem 3 (Scaling with Isosceles Triangles)

The ratio of the equal sides to the base of an isosceles triangle is $5:2$. If the perimeter is 60, find the area of the triangle.

**Solution:** Let the equal sides be $5m$ each and the base be $2m$.
$$5m + 5m + 2m = 60$$
$$12m = 60$$
$$m = 5$$

So the equal sides are 25 each, and the base is 10.

To find the area, drop an altitude from the vertex angle to the base. This bisects the base (Property 3 from the notes: the altitude to the base of an isosceles triangle bisects the base). Half the base $= 5$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
$$h^2 + 5^2 = 25^2$$
$$h^2 = 625 - 25 = 600$$
$$h = \sqrt{600} = 10\sqrt{6}$$

$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10\sqrt{6} = \boxed{50\sqrt{6} \text{ square units}}$$

### Problem 4 (Percent Change with Variables)

If $x$ is increased by 40% and $y$ is decreased by 30%, by what percent does the value of $\dfrac{x^2}{y}$ change?

**Solution:** Let $Q = \dfrac{x^2}{y}$.

Factor of change for $x^2$: $(1.40)^2 = 1.96$
Factor of change for $\dfrac{1}{y}$: $\dfrac{1}{0.70} = \dfrac{10}{7} \approx 1.4286$

Factor of change for $Q$: $1.96 \times \dfrac{10}{7} = \dfrac{19.6}{7} = 2.80$

Percent change: $(2.80 - 1) \times 100\% = \boxed{180\% \text{ increase}}$

### Problem 5 (Three-Part Ratio with Combined Information)

The ratio of three numbers is $2:3:5$. The sum of the largest and smallest is 84 more than the middle number. Find all three numbers.

**Solution:** Let the numbers be $2m$, $3m$, and $5m$.

Given: (largest + smallest) - middle $= 84$
$$(5m + 2m) - 3m = 84$$
$$4m = 84$$
$$m = 21$$

The three numbers are $2(21) = 42$, $3(21) = 63$, and $5(21) = \boxed{105}$.

### Problem 6 (Rate with Head Start)

A cargo ship leaves a port traveling at 18 knots. Three hours later, a faster ship leaves the same port traveling at 30 knots along the same route. How many hours after the faster ship departs will it overtake the cargo ship?

**Solution:** When the faster ship departs, the cargo ship has already traveled $18 \times 3 = 54$ nautical miles.

Let $t$ = hours after the faster ship departs when overtaking occurs.

At the overtaking point:
$$30t = 18t + 54$$
$$12t = 54$$
$$t = 4.5 \text{ hours}$$

The faster ship overtakes the cargo ship $\boxed{4.5 \text{ hours}}$ after its departure.

## 6.1 Foundations of Inequalities

### 6.1.1 What Is an Inequality?

An inequality is a mathematical statement that compares two expressions using one of the following symbols:

- **<** (less than)
- **>** (greater than)
- **≤** (less than or equal to)
- **≥** (greater than or equal to)
- **≠** (not equal to)

Unlike an equation, which asserts that two quantities are exactly equal, an inequality asserts a relationship of relative magnitude. The solution to an inequality is typically a **set of values** (often an interval or union of intervals) rather than a single value.

**Example 6.1:** The inequality $x > 3$ means that $x$ can be any real number strictly greater than 3. The solution set is $(3, \infty)$.

**Example 6.2:** The inequality $-2 \leq y \leq 5$ means that $y$ can be any real number between $-2$ and $5$, inclusive. The solution set is $[-2, 5]$.

### 6.1.2 Properties of Inequalities

The properties of inequalities are similar to those of equations, with one critical exception involving multiplication and division by negative numbers.

**Property 1: Addition and Subtraction**
If $a < b$, then $a + c < b + c$ and $a - c < b - c$ for any real number $c$.

*Reasoning:* Adding or subtracting the same quantity from both sides preserves the inequality relationship.

**Property 2: Multiplication and Division by a Positive Number**
If $a < b$ and $c > 0$, then $ac < bc$ and $\frac{a}{c} < \frac{b}{c}$.

*Reasoning:* Multiplying or dividing both sides by a positive number preserves the direction of the inequality.

**Property 3: Multiplication and Division by a Negative Number (CRITICAL)**
If $a < b$ and $c < 0$, then $ac > bc$ and $\frac{a}{c} > \frac{b}{c}$.

*Reasoning:* Multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number **reverses** the direction of the inequality. This is the single most important rule to remember when working with inequalities.

**Example 6.3:** Solve $-3x < 12$.

Dividing both sides by $-3$ (a negative number), we must reverse the inequality:

$$x > -4$$

**Property 4: Transitivity**
If $a < b$ and $b < c$, then $a < c$.

**Property 5: The Trichotomy Property**
For any two real numbers $a$ and $b$, exactly one of the following is true:
- $a < b$
- $a = b$
- $a > b$

### 6.1.3 Interval Notation

Interval notation provides a compact way to express solution sets of inequalities.

| Inequality | Interval Notation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| $x > a$ | $(a, \infty)$ | All numbers greater than $a$ |
| $x \geq a$ | $[a, \infty)$ | All numbers greater than or equal to $a$ |
| $x < b$ | $(-\infty, b)$ | All numbers less than $b$ |
| $x \leq b$ | $(-\infty, b]$ | All numbers less than or equal to $b$ |
| $a < x < b$ | $(a, b)$ | All numbers between $a$ and $b$ (exclusive) |
| $a \leq x \leq b$ | $[a, b]$ | All numbers between $a$ and $b$ (inclusive) |
| $a < x \leq b$ | $(a, b]$ | Greater than $a$, less than or equal to $b$ |
| $a \leq x < b$ | $[a, b)$ | Greater than or equal to $a$, less than $b$ |

**Key conventions:**
- Parentheses $(~)$ indicate that the endpoint is **not** included.
- Square brackets $[~]$ indicate that the endpoint **is** included.
- The symbol $\infty$ (infinity) always gets a parenthesis, never a bracket, because infinity is not a real number.

### 6.1.4 Graphing Inequalities on the Number Line

To graph an inequality on a number line:

1. Draw a number line with the critical value marked.
2. Use an **open circle** (○) for strict inequalities ($<$ or $>$).
3. Use a **closed circle** (●) for inclusive inequalities ($\leq$ or $\geq$).
4. Shade the region that satisfies the inequality.

**Example 6.4:** Graph $x \leq 3$ on the number line.

Draw a closed circle at 3 and shade everything to the left.

**Example 6.5:** Graph $-1 < x \leq 4$ on the number line.

Draw an open circle at $-1$, a closed circle at $4$, and shade the region between them.

## 6.2 Solving Linear Inequalities

### 6.2.1 One-Step Inequalities

**Example 6.6:** Solve $x + 7 > 12$.

$$x + 7 > 12$$
$$x > 5$$

**Example 6.7:** Solve $-4x \leq 20$.

Dividing by $-4$ (negative), reverse the inequality:

$$x \geq -5$$

### 6.2.2 Two-Step Inequalities

**Example 6.8:** Solve $5x - 3 \geq 22$.

$$5x - 3 \geq 22$$
$$5x \geq 25$$
$$x \geq 5$$

### 6.2.3 Multi-Step Inequalities

**Example 6.9:** Solve $3(2x + 1) - 4(x - 2) < 15$.

$$6x + 3 - 4x + 8 < 15$$
$$2x + 11 < 15$$
$$2x < 4$$
$$x < 2$$

### 6.2.4 Compound Inequalities

A compound inequality combines two inequalities using "and" or "or."

**And (Intersection):** Both conditions must be true simultaneously.

**Example 6.10:** Solve $-3 < 2x + 1 \leq 7$.

Split into two inequalities:
$$-3 < 2x + 1 \quad \text{and} \quad 2x + 1 \leq 7$$

First: $-3 < 2x + 1 \Rightarrow -4 < 2x \Rightarrow -2 < x$

Second: $2x + 1 \leq 7 \Rightarrow 2x \leq 6 \Rightarrow x \leq 3$

Combined: $-2 < x \leq 3$, or in interval notation: $(-2, 3]$.

**Or (Union):** At least one condition must be true.

**Example 6.11:** Solve $x < -1$ or $x \geq 4$.

Solution: $(-\infty, -1) \cup [4, \infty)$.

### 6.2.5 Special Cases

**Case 1: No Solution**

**Example 6.12:** Solve $x + 3 < x + 1$.

$$x + 3 < x + 1$$
$$3 < 1$$

This is a contradiction. There is **no solution**.

**Case 2: All Real Numbers**

**Example 6.13:** Solve $x + 3 > x + 1$.

$$x + 3 > x + 1$$
$$3 > 1$$

This is always true. The solution is **all real numbers**, $(-\infty, \infty)$.

---

## 6.3 Absolute Value

### 6.3.1 Definition of Absolute Value

The absolute value of a real number $x$, denoted $|x|$, represents the distance from $x$ to 0 on the number line. Distance is always non-negative.

$$|x| = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases}$$

**Key properties:**
- $|x| \geq 0$ for all real $x$
- $|-x| = |x|$
- $|x|^2 = x^2$
- $|xy| = |x||y|$
- $\left|\frac{x}{y}\right| = \frac{|x|}{|y|}$ for $y \neq 0$

### 6.3.2 Solving Absolute Value Equations

**Theorem:** For $a \geq 0$, $|x| = a$ if and only if $x = a$ or $x = -a$.

**Example 6.14:** Solve $|2x - 3| = 7$.

$$2x - 3 = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 3 = -7$$
$$2x = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad 2x = -4$$
$$x = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2$$

**Example 6.15:** Solve $|x + 4| = -3$.

Since absolute value is always non-negative, there is **no solution**.

### 6.3.3 Solving Absolute Value Inequalities

**Case 1: $|x| < a$ (or $|x| \leq a$) where $a > 0$**

This means the distance from $x$ to 0 is less than $a$.

$$|x| < a \iff -a < x < a$$

$$|x| \leq a \iff -a \leq x \leq a$$

**Example 6.16:** Solve $|3x - 6| \leq 12$.

$$-12 \leq 3x - 6 \leq 12$$
$$-6 \leq 3x \leq 18$$
$$-2 \leq x \leq 6$$

Solution: $[-2, 6]$.

**Case 2: $|x| > a$ (or $|x| \geq a$) where $a > 0$**

This means the distance from $x$ to 0 is greater than $a$.

$$|x| > a \iff x < -a \quad \text{or} \quad x > a$$

$$|x| \geq a \iff x \leq -a \quad \text{or} \quad x \geq a$$

**Example 6.17:** Solve $|2x + 1| > 5$.

$$2x + 1 < -5 \quad \text{or} \quad 2x + 1 > 5$$
$$2x < -6 \quad \text{or} \quad 2x > 4$$
$$x < -3 \quad \text{or} \quad x > 2$$

Solution: $(-\infty, -3) \cup (2, \infty)$.

**Case 3: When $a \leq 0$**

- $|x| < 0$: **No solution** (absolute value can never be negative).
- $|x| \leq 0$: Only solution is $x = 0$.
- $|x| > 0$: All real numbers except $x = 0$, i.e., $(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)$.
- $|x| \geq 0$: **All real numbers**, $(-\infty, \infty)$.

### 6.3.4 Absolute Value with Quadratic Expressions

**Example 6.18:** Solve $|x^2 - 4| < 3$.

$$-3 < x^2 - 4 < 3$$
$$1 < x^2 < 7$$

For $x^2 > 1$: $x < -1$ or $x > 1$.

For $x^2 < 7$: $-\sqrt{7} < x < \sqrt{7}$.

Combining: $(-\sqrt{7}, -1) \cup (1, \sqrt{7})$.

## 6.4 Graphical Analysis of Inequalities

### 6.4.1 The Cartesian Coordinate System

The Cartesian plane consists of two perpendicular number lines:
- The **x-axis** (horizontal)
- The **y-axis** (vertical)

Any point in the plane is represented by an ordered pair $(x, y)$.

The axes divide the plane into four **quadrants**:

| Quadrant | x-coordinate | y-coordinate |
|---|---|---|
| I | Positive | Positive |
| II | Negative | Positive |
| III | Negative | Negative |
| IV | Positive | Negative |

Points on the axes themselves do not belong to any quadrant.

### 6.4.2 Graphing Linear Inequalities in Two Variables

To graph a linear inequality of the form $Ax + By < C$ (or $>$, $\leq$, $\geq$):

1. **Graph the boundary line** $Ax + By = C$.
   - Use a **solid line** for $\leq$ or $\geq$ (points on the line are included).
   - Use a **dashed line** for $<$ or $>$ (points on the line are not included).

2. **Choose a test point** not on the boundary line. The origin $(0,0)$ is the most convenient choice (as long as the line does not pass through the origin).

3. **Shade the appropriate region.**
   - If the test point satisfies the inequality, shade the half-plane containing the test point.
   - If the test point does not satisfy the inequality, shade the opposite half-plane.

**Example 6.19:** Graph $2x + 3y \leq 6$.

**Step 1:** Graph the line $2x + 3y = 6$.

Find intercepts:
- x-intercept: set $y = 0$: $2x = 6 \Rightarrow x = 3$. Point: $(3, 0)$.
- y-intercept: set $x = 0$: $3y = 6 \Rightarrow y = 2$. Point: $(0, 2)$.

Draw a **solid line** through $(3, 0)$ and $(0, 2)$.

**Step 2:** Test point $(0, 0)$:

$$2(0) + 3(0) = 0 \leq 6 \quad \checkmark$$

**Step 3:** Shade the region containing $(0, 0)$, which is the region **below** the line.

**Example 6.20:** Graph $y > 2x - 1$.

**Step 1:** Graph $y = 2x - 1$ as a **dashed line**.

Slope = 2, y-intercept = $-1$.

**Step 2:** Test point $(0, 0)$:

$$0 > 2(0) - 1$$
$$0 > -1 \quad \checkmark$$

**Step 3:** Shade the region containing $(0, 0)$, which is the region **above** the line.

### 6.4.3 Graphing Absolute Value Inequalities in Two Variables

**Example 6.21:** Graph $|y| < 2$.

This means $-2 < y < 2$. The solution is the horizontal strip between $y = -2$ and $y = 2$, with dashed boundary lines.

**Example 6.22:** Graph $|x| \geq 3$.

This means $x \leq -3$ or $x \geq 3$. The solution is the region to the left of $x = -3$ and to the right of $x = 3$, with solid boundary lines.

### 6.4.4 Systems of Linear Inequalities

A system of linear inequalities is a set of two or more linear inequalities considered simultaneously. The solution set is the **intersection** (overlap) of the individual solution sets.

**Example 6.23:** Graph the system:
$$x + y \leq 4$$
$$x - y \geq 0$$
$$x \geq 0$$

**Step 1:** Graph $x + y = 4$ as a solid line. Test $(0,0)$: $0 \leq 4$ ✓. Shade below.

**Step 2:** Graph $x - y = 0$ (i.e., $y = x$) as a solid line. Test $(1, 0)$: $1 - 0 = 1 \geq 0$ ✓. Shade below the line $y = x$.

**Step 3:** Graph $x = 0$ (the y-axis) as a solid line. Shade to the right.

**Step 4:** The solution is the overlapping (shaded) region common to all three inequalities.

### 6.4.5 Finding Vertices of the Feasible Region

The vertices (corner points) of the feasible region are found by solving the systems of equations formed by the boundary lines that intersect at each vertex.

**Example 6.24:** For the system in Example 6.23, find the vertices.

**Vertex A:** Intersection of $x + y = 4$ and $x - y = 0$.

Adding: $2x = 4 \Rightarrow x = 2$, so $y = 2$. Vertex: $(2, 2)$.

**Vertex B:** Intersection of $x + y = 4$ and $x = 0$.

$y = 4$. Vertex: $(0, 4)$.

**Vertex C:** Intersection of $x - y = 0$ and $x = 0$.

$y = 0$. Vertex: $(0, 0)$.

The feasible region is the triangle with vertices $(0, 0)$, $(0, 4)$, and $(2, 2)$.

## 6.5 Inequalities and the SAT/ACT

### 6.5.1 Common SAT/ACT Inequality Question Types

**Type 1: Direct Solving**

Solve the inequality and select the correct solution set.

**Example 6.25:** If $5 - 3x \geq 11$, which of the following is the solution?

$$5 - 3x \geq 11$$
$$-3x \geq 6$$
$$x \leq 2$$

**Type 2: Graphical Interpretation**

Identify the graph that represents the solution set.

**Example 6.26:** Which number line represents the solution to $-4 < 2x \leq 6$?

Divide all parts by 2: $-2 < x \leq 3$.

This is an open circle at $-2$, a closed circle at $3$, with shading between.

**Type 3: Word Problems**

Translate a word problem into an inequality and solve.

**Example 6.27:** A company charges a flat fee of $\$50$ plus $\$25$ per hour for a service. If a customer wants to spend at most $\$200$, what is the maximum number of hours they can purchase?

Let $h$ = number of hours.

$$50 + 25h \leq 200$$
$$25h \leq 150$$
$$h \leq 6$$

The maximum number of hours is **6**.

**Type 4: Systems of Inequalities in Context**

**Example 6.28:** A farmer has at most 100 acres to plant with corn and soybeans. Corn requires 2 hours of labor per acre and soybeans require 1 hour per acre. The farmer has at most 160 hours of labor available. If $x$ represents acres of corn and $y$ represents acres of soybeans, which system represents the constraints?

$$x + y \leq 100$$
$$2x + y \leq 160$$
$$x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0$$

### 6.5.2 Absolute Value on the SAT/ACT

**Example 6.29:** If $|x - 3| < 5$, which of the following represents all possible values of $x$?

$$-5 < x - 3 < 5$$
$$-2 < x < 8$$

**Example 6.30:** If $|2x + 1| \geq 7$, what is the solution set?

$$2x + 1 \leq -7 \quad \text{or} \quad 2x + 1 \geq 7$$
$$2x \leq -8 \quad \text{or} \quad 2x \geq 6$$
$$x \leq -4 \quad \text{or} \quad x \geq 3$$

Solution: $(-\infty, -4] \cup [3, \infty)$.

### 6.5.3 Key Strategies for Inequality Problems

1. **Always check whether you're multiplying or dividing by a negative number.** If so, reverse the inequality sign.

2. **When dealing with fractions**, multiply both sides by the LCD to eliminate denominators, but be careful about the sign of the LCD.

3. **For compound inequalities**, solve each part separately and find the intersection (for "and") or union (for "or").

4. **For absolute value inequalities**, remember:
   - $|x| < a$ → "and" type → $-a < x < a$
   - $|x| > a$ → "or" type → $x < -a$ or $x > a$

5. **Always verify your answer** by testing a value from your solution set in the original inequality.

6. **On the number line**, remember: open circle for strict inequality, closed circle for inclusive.

## 6.6 Advanced Inequality Topics

### 6.6.1 Rational Inequalities

Rational inequalities involve fractions with variables in the denominator. The key technique is the **sign chart** (or **test interval**) method.

**Example 6.31:** Solve $\frac{x - 2}{x + 3} \geq 0$.

**Step 1:** Find critical values.
- Numerator zero: $x = 2$
- Denominator zero: $x = -3$ (excluded from domain)

**Step 2:** Divide the number line into intervals using critical values: $(-\infty, -3)$, $(-3, 2)$, $(2, \infty)$.

**Step 3:** Test the sign of the expression in each interval.

| Interval | Test Point | $\frac{x-2}{x+3}$ | Sign |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(-\infty, -3)$ | $x = -4$ | $\frac{-6}{-1} = 6$ | Positive |
| $(-3, 2)$ | $x = 0$ | $\frac{-2}{3}$ | Negative |
| $(2, \infty)$ | $x = 3$ | $\frac{1}{6}$ | Positive |

**Step 4:** We want $\geq 0$, so we need positive or zero.

- Positive on $(-\infty, -3)$ and $(2, \infty)$
- Zero at $x = 2$ (numerator is zero, denominator is not)
- Undefined at $x = -3$

Solution: $(-\infty, -3) \cup [2, \infty)$.

### 6.6.2 Quadratic Inequalities

**Example 6.32:** Solve $x^2 - 5x + 6 < 0$.

**Step 1:** Factor: $(x - 2)(x - 3) < 0$.

**Step 2:** Critical values: $x = 2$ and $x = 3$.

**Step 3:** Sign chart:

| Interval | $(x-2)$ | $(x-3)$ | Product |
|---|---|---|---|
| $(-\infty, 2)$ | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ |
| $(2, 3)$ | $+$ | $-$ | $-$ |
| $(3, \infty)$ | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ |

**Step 4:** We want $< 0$ (negative), so the solution is $(2, 3)$.

### 6.6.3 Inequalities Involving Multiple Absolute Values

**Example 6.33:** Solve $|x - 1| + |x + 2| < 7$.

**Step 1:** Find critical points where each absolute value expression equals zero: $x = 1$ and $x = -2$.

**Step 2:** Consider three cases.

**Case 1:** $x < -2$

Both expressions are negative:
$$-(x - 1) - (x + 2) < 7$$
$$-x + 1 - x - 2 < 7$$
$$-2x - 1 < 7$$
$$-2x < 8$$
$$x > -4$$

Combined with $x < -2$: $-4 < x < -2$.

**Case 2:** $-2 \leq x < 1$

$$-(x - 1) + (x + 2) < 7$$
$$-x + 1 + x + 2 < 7$$
$$3 < 7$$

This is always true. So all $x$ in $[-2, 1)$ satisfy the inequality.

**Case 3:** $x \geq 1$

$$(x - 1) + (x + 2) < 7$$
$$2x + 1 < 7$$
$$2x < 6$$
$$x < 3$$

Combined with $x \geq 1$: $1 \leq x < 3$.

**Final Solution:** $(-4, -2) \cup [-2, 1) \cup [1, 3) = (-4, 3)$.

---

## 6.7 Practice Problems

$$4x - 8 = 20 \quad \text{or} \quad 4x - 8 = -20$$
$$4x = 28 \quad \text{or} \quad 4x = -12$$
$$x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -3$$

**Problem 5:** Solve $|3x + 6| \leq 15$.

$$-15 \leq 3x + 6 \leq 15$$
$$-21 \leq 3x \leq 9$$
$$-7 \leq x \leq 3$$

Solution: $[-7, 3]$.

**Problem 6:** Solve $|5 - 2x| > 9$.

$$5 - 2x < -9 \quad \text{or} \quad 5 - 2x > 9$$
$$-2x < -14 \quad \text{or} \quad 5 - 2x > 9$$
$$x > 7 \quad \text{or} \quad -2x > 4$$
$$x > 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x < -2$$

Solution: $(-\infty, -2) \cup (7, \infty)$.

### Set C: Graphical Analysis

**Problem 7:** Which inequality is represented by the shaded region below the line $y = -2x + 4$?

Since the region is **below** the line and the boundary is included (solid line):

$$y \leq -2x + 4$$

**Problem 8:** Graph the system $y \geq x - 1$ and $y < 2x + 3$. Find the intersection point of the boundary lines.

Set $x - 1 = 2x + 3$:

$$-1 - 3 = 2x - x$$
$$x = -4, \quad y = -5$$

Intersection point: $(-4, -5)$.

### Set D: Challenging Problems

**Problem 9:** Solve $\frac{x + 1}{x - 2} \leq \frac{x - 3}{x + 4}$.

Bring all terms to one side:

$$\frac{x + 1}{x - 2} - \frac{x - 3}{x + 4} \leq 0$$

$$\frac{(x+1)(x+4) - (x-3)(x-2)}{(x-2)(x+4)} \leq 0$$

Numerator: $(x^2 + 5x + 4) - (x^2 - 5x + 6) = 10x - 2$

$$\frac{10x - 2}{(x - 2)(x + 4)} \leq 0$$

Critical values: $x = \frac{1}{5}$, $x = 2$, $x = -4$.

Sign chart:

| Interval | $10x-2$ | $x-2$ | $x+4$ | Overall Sign |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $(-\infty, -4)$ | $-$ | $-$ | $-$ | $-$ |
| $(-4, \frac{1}{5})$ | $-$ | $-$ | $+$ | $+$ |
| $(\frac{1}{5}, 2)$ | $+$ | $-$ | $+$ | $-$ |
| $(2, \infty)$ | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ | $+$ |

We want $\leq 0$ (negative or zero): $(-\infty, -4) \cup [\frac{1}{5}, 2)$.

Note: $x = -4$ and $x = 2$ are excluded (denominator zero), but $x = \frac{1}{5}$ is included (numerator zero).

**Problem 10:** Find all values of $x$ such that $|x^2 - 9| < 7$.

$$-7 < x^2 - 9 < 7$$
$$2 < x^2 < 16$$

For $x^2 > 2$: $x < -\sqrt{2}$ or $x > \sqrt{2}$.

For $x^2 < 16$: $-4 < x < 4$.

Combining: $(-4, -\sqrt{2}) \cup (\sqrt{2}, 4)$.

| Rational inequalities | Sign chart method with critical values |
| Quadratic inequalities | Factor, find zeros, sign chart |

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Inequalities describe ranges of values, not single values.
2. The most common error is forgetting to reverse the inequality when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.
3. Absolute value inequalities split into two cases: "and" for less-than, "or" for greater-than.
4. Graphical analysis provides visual confirmation of algebraic solutions.
5. Always check endpoints carefully—determine whether they should be included or excluded.

# Chapter 7: Percents, Ratios, and Mixture Problems

## 7.1 — Percents: The Complete Framework

### 7.1.1 — What Is a Percent?

A **percent** is a ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. The word itself comes from the Latin *per centum*, meaning "by the hundred." The symbol **%** is a stylized form of the fraction $\frac{1}{100}$.

**Fundamental identity:**

$$x\% = \frac{x}{100}$$

This identity is the single most important fact about percents. Every percent problem, no matter how complex, ultimately reduces to this conversion.

**Examples:**
- $25\% = \frac{25}{100} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25$
- $150\% = \frac{150}{100} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5$
- $0.3\% = \frac{0.3}{100} = 0.003$
- $x\% = \frac{x}{100}$ (the algebraic form you will use constantly)

---

### 7.1.2 — The Three Core Percent Problems

Every percent problem on the SAT/ACT fits one of three templates. Mastering these three templates means you can solve any percent problem.

**Template 1: Finding the Part (the "is" problem)**

> $x\%$ of $y$ is what number?

$$\text{Part} = \left(\frac{x}{100}\right) \cdot y$$

**Example:** What is $30\%$ of $250$?

$$\text{Part} = \frac{30}{100} \times 250 = 0.3 \times 250 = 75$$

---

**Template 2: Finding the Whole (the "of" problem)**

> $x$ is $y\%$ of what number?

$$\text{Whole} = \frac{x}{\left(\frac{y}{100}\right)} = \frac{100x}{y}$$

**Example:** $45$ is $15\%$ of what number?

$$\text{Whole} = \frac{45}{0.15} = \frac{4500}{15} = 300$$

---

**Template 3: Finding the Percent (the "%" problem)**

> $x$ is what percent of $y$?

$$\text{Percent} = \frac{x}{y} \times 100$$

**Example:** $18$ is what percent of $90$?

$$\text{Percent} = \frac{18}{90} \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%$$

---

### 7.1.3 — The Percent Equation (Universal Form)

All three templates can be unified into a single equation:

$$\text{Part} = \text{Percent (as decimal)} \times \text{Whole}$$

Or, using the letter $P$ for percent (as a decimal), $W$ for whole, and $A$ for the amount (part):

$$A = P \cdot W$$

This is sometimes called the **"is-over-of"** formula:

$$\frac{\text{is}}{\text{of}} = \frac{\%}{100}$$

**Example:** $27$ is $45\%$ of what number?

$$\frac{27}{W} = \frac{45}{100}$$
$$45W = 2700$$
$$W = 60$$

---

### 7.1.4 — Percent Increase and Decrease

**Percent Increase:**

$$\text{Percent Increase} = \frac{\text{New} - \text{Old}}{\text{Old}} \times 100 = \left(\frac{\text{New}}{\text{Old}} - 1\right) \times 100$$

**Percent Decrease:**

$$\text{Percent Decrease} = \frac{\text{Old} - \text{New}}{\text{Old}} \times 100 = \left(1 - \frac{\text{New}}{\text{Old}}\right) \times 100$$

**Key insight:** The denominator is ALWAYS the **original** (the "standard" or "before" value). This is the most common source of errors on standardized tests.

**Example:** A shirt originally priced at $\$40$ is on sale for $\$32$. What is the percent decrease?

$$\text{Percent Decrease} = \frac{40 - 32}{40} \times 100 = \frac{8}{40} \times 100 = 20\%$$

---

### 7.1.5 — The "Standard" — A Critical Concept

In any comparison, the **standard** is the value you are comparing *to* — it is the reference point, the baseline, the denominator.

**Rule:** The standard is always the second item in a comparison phrase:

- "A is what percent **of** B?" → B is the standard
- "A is what percent **greater than** B?" → B is the standard
- "A is what percent **less than** B?" → B is the standard

**Example:** If Ashish is $250\%$ older than Bob, then Bob is what percent younger than Ashish?

Let Bob's age = $x$. Then Ashish's age = $x + 2.5x = 3.5x$.

Bob is younger than Ashish by:

$$\frac{3.5x - x}{3.5x} \times 100 = \frac{2.5}{3.5} \times 100 = \frac{5}{7} \times 100 \approx 71.43\%$$

**Critical lesson:** If A is $250\%$ *older* than B, B is NOT $250\%$ *younger* than A. The standard changes, so the percentage changes. This asymmetry is tested frequently.

---

### 7.1.6 — Converting Percents to Factors

For quick mental math and the "factor of change" approach, convert percent changes to multiplication factors:

| Percent Change | Factor |
|---|---|
| Increase by $20\%$ | $\times 1.20$ |
| Increase by $150\%$ | $\times 2.50$ |
| Decrease by $20\%$ | $\times 0.80$ |
| Decrease by $75\%$ | $\times 0.25$ |

**General rule:**
- Increase by $p\%$: multiply by $\left(1 + \frac{p}{100}\right)$
- Decrease by $p\%$: multiply by $\left(1 - \frac{p}{100}\right)$

**Example:** After a $20\%$ discount and then a $10\%$ tax, what is the final price of a $\$100$ item?

$$\$100 \times 0.80 \times 1.10 = \$100 \times 0.88 = \$88$$

**Important:** Discounts and taxes are applied sequentially, NOT added together. A $20\%$ discount followed by a $10\%$ tax is NOT the same as a $10\%$ decrease.

---

### 7.1.7 — Successive Percent Changes

When two or more percent changes are applied in sequence, multiply the factors:

$$\text{Final} = \text{Original} \times (\text{factor}_1) \times (\text{factor}_2) \times \cdots$$

**Example:** A population increases by $10\%$ one year and then decreases by $10\%$ the next year. What is the net change?

$$\text{Factor} = 1.10 \times 0.90 = 0.99$$

The population ends at $99\%$ of its original value — a net decrease of $1\%$.

**Key insight:** A $p\%$ increase followed by a $p\%$ decrease always results in a net loss. The net change is $-\left(\frac{p}{100}\right)^2 \times 100\%$.

---

### 7.1.8 — Finding the Original Value After a Percent Change

This is one of the most commonly tested percent scenarios.

**If a value increased by $p\%$ to become $N$:**

$$\text{Original} = \frac{N}{1 + \frac{p}{100}}$$

**If a value decreased by $p\%$ to become $N$:**

$$\text{Original} = \frac{N}{1 - \frac{p}{100}}$$

**Example:** After a $15\%$ discount, a jacket costs $\$85$. What was the original price?

$$\text{Original} = \frac{85}{1 - 0.15} = \frac{85}{0.85} = \$100$$

---

### 7.1.9 — Percent of a Percent

**Example:** A store offers a $20\%$ discount, and then an additional $10\%$ off the already-discounted price. What is the total percent discount?

$$\text{Total factor} = 0.80 \times 0.90 = 0.72$$

This means the customer pays $72\%$ of the original price, so the total discount is $28\%$.

**Common mistake:** Students often add $20\% + 10\% = 30\%$. This is wrong because the second $10\%$ is applied to a smaller base.

---

### 7.1.10 — Practice Problems: Percents

**Problem 1:** If $40\%$ of $x$ is equal to $60\%$ of $y$, what is the ratio of $x$ to $y$?

$$0.4x = 0.6y$$
$$\frac{x}{y} = \frac{0.6}{0.4} = \frac{3}{2}$$

**Answer:** $x:y = 3:2$

---

**Problem 2:** A number is increased by $25\%$, then decreased by $x\%$, returning to the original number. What is $x$?

Let the original number be $N$.

After $25\%$ increase: $1.25N$

After $x\%$ decrease: $1.25N \times \left(1 - \frac{x}{100}\right) = N$

$$1.25\left(1 - \frac{x}{100}\right) = 1$$
$$1 - \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1}{1.25} = 0.8$$
$$\frac{x}{100} = 0.2$$
$$x = 20$$

**Answer:** $x = 20\%$

---

**Problem 3:** In a class, $60\%$ of the students are girls. If $25\%$ of the girls and $40\%$ of the boys wear glasses, what percent of the entire class wears glasses?

Assume $100$ students total.
- Girls: $60$, Boys: $40$
- Girls with glasses: $0.25 \times 60 = 15$
- Boys with glasses: $0.40 \times 40 = 16$
- Total with glasses: $15 + 16 = 31$

**Answer:** $31\%$

---

**Problem 4:** A store marks up a product by $40\%$ above cost, then puts it on sale at $25\%$ off the marked price. If the final selling price is $\$126$, what was the original cost?

Let cost = $C$.

Marked price: $1.40C$

Sale price: $1.40C \times 0.75 = 1.05C$

$$1.05C = 126$$
$$C = \frac{126}{1.05} = \$120$$

**Answer:** $\$120$

---

**Problem 5:** The price of a stock increases by $50\%$ on Monday and decreases by $50\%$ on Tuesday. What is the net percent change?

$$\text{Factor} = 1.50 \times 0.50 = 0.75$$

The stock ends at $75\%$ of its original value.

**Answer:** $25\%$ decrease

---

## 7.2 — Ratios: The Complete Framework

### 7.2.1 — What Is a Ratio?

A **ratio** is a comparison of two or more quantities by division. A ratio $a:b$ can be written as $\frac{a}{b}$.

**Key property:** Ratios do not have units. They represent a *relative* comparison, not an absolute one.

**Example:** If the ratio of boys to girls is $3:5$, this does NOT mean there are exactly $3$ boys and $5$ girls. It means for every $3$ boys, there are $5$ girls. The actual numbers could be $3$ and $5$, or $6$ and $10$, or $30$ and $50$, etc.

---

### 7.2.2 — The Parts Model

When a ratio $a:b$ is given, we introduce a **multiplier** $m$ (sometimes called the "scale factor"):

- First quantity = $am$
- Second quantity = $bm$
- Total = $(a + b)m$

This is the single most important technique for solving ratio problems.

**Example:** The ratio of boys to girls in a class is $3:5$. If there are $40$ students total, how many boys are there?

$$3m + 5m = 40$$
$$8m = 40$$
$$m = 5$$

Boys: $3 \times 5 = 15$

---

### 7.2.3 — Three-Part Ratios

For a ratio $a:b:c$:

- First quantity = $am$
- Second quantity = $bm$
- Third quantity = $cm$
- Total = $(a + b + c)m$

**Example:** The ratio of three angles in a triangle is $2:3:5$. What is the measure of the largest angle?

$$2m + 3m + 5m = 180°$$
$$10m = 180°$$
$$m = 18°$$

Largest angle: $5 \times 18° = 90°$

---

### 7.2.4 — Ratios and Fractions

If the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $a:b$, then:

- $A$ is $\frac{a}{a+b}$ of the total
- $B$ is $\frac{b}{a+b}$ of the total

**Example:** The ratio of salt to water in a solution is $2:13$. What fraction of the solution is salt?

$$\frac{2}{2 + 13} = \frac{2}{15}$$

---

### 7.2.5 — Changing Ratios

When quantities are added or removed, ratios change. The key is to track what stays constant.

**Example:** A bag contains red and blue marbles in the ratio $3:7$. If $10$ red marbles are added, the ratio becomes $2:3$. How many blue marbles are there?

Let the original number of red marbles be $3m$ and blue marbles be $7m$.

After adding $10$ red marbles:

$$\frac{3m + 10}{7m} = \frac{2}{3}$$
$$3(3m + 10) = 2(7m)$$
$$9m + 30 = 14m$$
$$30 = 5m$$
$$m = 6$$

Blue marbles: $7 \times 6 = 42$

---

### 7.2.6 — Ratios with Variables

**Example:** If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{b}{c} = \frac{5}{6}$, what is $\frac{a}{c}$?

$$\frac{a}{c} = \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{b}{c} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{15}{24} = \frac{5}{8}$$

---

### 7.2.7 — Practice Problems: Ratios

**Problem 1:** The ratio of the ages of Alice, Bob, and Charlie is $2:3:5$. If the sum of their ages is $60$, how old is Charlie?

$$2m + 3m + 5m = 60$$
$$10m = 60$$
$$m = 6$$

Charlie: $5 \times 6 = 30$

**Answer:** $30$ years old

---

**Problem 2:** A mixture contains alcohol and water in the ratio $7:3$. If $20$ liters of water are added, the ratio becomes $7:5$. Find the original quantity of the mixture.

Let original alcohol = $7m$, original water = $3m$.

$$\frac{7m}{3m + 20} = \frac{7}{5}$$
$$5(7m) = 7(3m + 20)$$
$$35m = 21m + 140$$
$$14m = 140$$
$$m = 10$$

Original mixture: $7m + 3m = 10m = 100$ liters

**Answer:** $100$ liters

---

**Problem 3:** Two numbers are in the ratio $5:8$. If each number is increased by $12$, the ratio becomes $7:10$. Find the original numbers.

Let the numbers be $5m$ and $8m$.

$$\frac{5m + 12}{8m + 12} = \frac{7}{10}$$
$$10(5m + 12) = 7(8m + 12)$$
$$50m + 120 = 56m + 84$$
$$36 = 6m$$
$$m = 6$$

Original numbers: $5 \times 6 = 30$ and $8 \times 6 = 48$

**Answer:** $30$ and $48$

---

**Problem 4:** The ratio of the perimeter of square A to the perimeter of square B is $3:5$. What is the ratio of the area of square A to the area of square B?

Perimeter ratio = side length ratio = $3:5$

Area ratio = $(3)^2:(5)^2 = 9:25$

**Answer:** $9:25$

---

## 7.3 — Rates and Proportions

### 7.3.1 — What Is a Rate?

A **rate** is a special type of ratio that compares two quantities with different units.

**Common rates:**
- Speed: $\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$ (miles per hour, meters per second)
- Density: $\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}$ (grams per cubic centimeter)
- Unit price: $\frac{\text{cost}}{\text{quantity}}$ (dollars per pound)
- Work rate: $\frac{\text{work done}}{\text{time}}$ (jobs per hour)

---

### 7.3.2 — The Rate Formula

$$\text{Quantity} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}$$

This is the fundamental relationship. Depending on what you're solving for:

$$Q = R \times T, \quad R = \frac{Q}{T}, \quad T = \frac{Q}{R}$$

**Example:** A machine produces $120$ widgets in $3$ hours. At this rate, how many widgets does it produce in $7$ hours?

$$R = \frac{120}{3} = 40 \text{ widgets/hour}$$
$$Q = 40 \times 7 = 280 \text{ widgets}$$

---

### 7.3.3 — Average Speed

**Critical formula:**

$$\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}$$

**Common mistake:** The average speed is NOT the average of the speeds (unless the times are equal).

**Example:** A car travels from A to B at $60$ mph and returns from B to A at $40$ mph. What is the average speed for the round trip?

Let the distance from A to B be $d$.

- Time A→B: $\frac{d}{60}$
- Time B→A: $\frac{d}{40}$
- Total distance: $2d$
- Total time: $\frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = \frac{2d + 3d}{120} = \frac{5d}{120} = \frac{d}{24}$

$$\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2d}{\frac{d}{24}} = 48 \text{ mph}$$

**General formula for round trip with speeds $v_1$ and $v_2$:**

$$\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2v_1 v_2}{v_1 + v_2}$$

This is the **harmonic mean** of the two speeds.

---

### 7.3.4 — Direct and Inverse Proportion

**Direct Proportion:** If $y = kx$ (where $k$ is constant), then $y$ is directly proportional to $x$. When $x$ increases, $y$ increases by the same factor.

**Inverse Proportion:** If $y = \frac{k}{x}$ (where $k$ is constant), then $y$ is inversely proportional to $x$. When $x$ increases, $y$ decreases by the same factor.

**Example (Inverse):** If $6$ workers can complete a job in $8$ days, how many days will it take $12$ workers?

$$6 \times 8 = 12 \times d$$
$$d = \frac{48}{12} = 4 \text{ days}$$

---

### 7.3.5 — Practice Problems: Rates

**Problem 1:** Two trains start from stations $300$ miles apart and travel toward each other. One travels at $60$ mph and the other at $40$ mph. How long until they meet?

Combined speed: $60 + 40 = 100$ mph

$$T = \frac{300}{100} = 3 \text{ hours}$$

**Answer:** $3$ hours

---

**Problem 2:** A pool can be filled by Pipe A in $6$ hours and by Pipe B in $4$ hours. How long will it take to fill the pool if both pipes are open?

Rate of A: $\frac{1}{6}$ pool/hour
Rate of B: $\frac{1}{4}$ pool/hour
Combined rate: $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2 + 3}{12} = \frac{5}{12}$ pool/hour

$$T = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{12}} = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours } 24 \text{ minutes}$$

**Answer:** $2.4$ hours (or $2$ hours $24$ minutes)

---

**Problem 3:** A car travels the first half of a trip at $30$ mph and the second half at $60$ mph. What is the average speed?

Let the total distance be $2d$.

- Time for first half: $\frac{d}{30}$
- Time for second half: $\frac{d}{60}$
- Total time: $\frac{d}{30} + \frac{d}{60} = \frac{2d + d}{60} = \frac{3d}{60} = \frac{d}{20}$

$$\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2d}{\frac{d}{20}} = 40 \text{ mph}$$

**Answer:** $40$ mph

---

## 7.4 — Mixture Problems

### 7.4.1 — The Mixture Framework

Mixture problems involve combining two or more substances with different concentrations to produce a mixture with a specific concentration.

**The fundamental equation:**

$$\text{Amount of substance in mixture} = \text{Concentration} \times \text{Volume}$$

For a mixture of two solutions:

$$C_1 V_1 + C_2 V_2 = C_f (V_1 + V_2)$$

where $C_1, C_2$ are the concentrations of the two solutions, $V_1, V_2$ are their volumes, and $C_f$ is the final concentration.

---

### 7.4.2 — The Table Method

For mixture problems, organize information in a table:

| | Solution 1 | Solution 2 | Mixture |
|---|---|---|---|
| Volume | $V_1$ | $V_2$ | $V_1 + V_2$ |
| Concentration | $C_1$ | $C_2$ | $C_f$ |
| Amount of substance | $C_1 V_1$ | $C_2 V_2$ | $C_f(V_1 + V_2)$ |

**Equation:** Amount from 1 + Amount from 2 = Amount in mixture

---

### 7.4.3 — Acid/Salt/Sugar Solution Problems

**Example:** How many liters of a $25\%$ acid solution must be added to $40$ liters of a $40\%$ acid solution to obtain a $30\%$ acid solution?

Let $x$ = liters of $25\%$ solution.

| | 25% Solution | 40% Solution | Mixture |
|---|---|---|---|
| Volume | $x$ | $40$ | $x + 40$ |
| Concentration | $0.25$ | $0.40$ | $0.30$ |
| Amount of acid | $0.25x$ | $16$ | $0.30(x + 40)$ |

$$0.25x + 16 = 0.30(x + 40)$$
$$0.25x + 16 = 0.30x + 12$$
$$4 = 0.05x$$
$$x = 80$$

**Answer:** $80$ liters

---

### 7.4.4 — Alloy Problems

**Example:** A jeweler has two alloys of gold. One is $60\%$ gold and the other is $80\%$ gold. How many grams of each should be mixed to obtain $100$ grams of an alloy that is $75\%$ gold?

Let $x$ = grams of $60\%$ alloy. Then $(100 - x)$ = grams of $80\%$ alloy.

$$0.60x + 0.80(100 - x) = 0.75(100)$$
$$0.60x + 80 - 0.80x = 75$$
$$-0.20x = -5$$
$$x = 25$$

**Answer:** $25$ grams of $60\%$ alloy and $75$ grams of $80\%$ alloy

---

### 7.4.5 — Replacement Problems

**Example:** A container has $50$ liters of a $40\%$ alcohol solution. How much of the solution should be replaced with pure alcohol to obtain a $50\%$ alcohol solution?

Let $x$ = liters removed and replaced.

When $x$ liters of the $40\%$ solution is removed, the amount of alcohol removed is $0.40x$.

The amount of alcohol remaining: $0.40(50) - 0.40x = 20 - 0.40x$

After adding $x$ liters of pure alcohol: $20 - 0.40x + x = 20 + 0.60x$

Final concentration:

$$\frac{20 + 0.60x}{50} = 0.50$$
$$20 + 0.60x = 25$$
$$0.60x = 5$$
$$x = \frac{25}{3} \approx 8.33 \text{ liters}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{25}{3}$ liters (or approximately $8.33$ liters)

---

### 7.4.6 — Practice Problems: Mixtures

**Problem 1:** How many liters of a $15\%$ saline solution must be mixed with $5$ liters of a $40\%$ saline solution to obtain a $25\%$ saline solution?

Let $x$ = liters of $15\%$ solution.

$$0.15x + 0.40(5) = 0.25(x + 5)$$
$$0.15x + 2 = 0.25x + 1.25$$
$$0.75 = 0.10x$$
$$x = 7.5$$

**Answer:** $7.5$ liters

---

**Problem 2:** A candy store sells chocolates at $\$8$ per pound and nuts at $\$3$ per pound. How many pounds of chocolates should be mixed with $10$ pounds of nuts to obtain a mixture worth $\$5$ per pound?

Let $x$ = pounds of chocolates.

$$8x + 3(10) = 5(x + 10)$$
$$8x + 30 = 5x + 50$$
$$3x = 20$$
$$x = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67$$

**Answer:** $\frac{20}{3}$ pounds (or approximately $6.67$ pounds)

---

**Problem 3:** A $20\%$ acid solution is mixed with a $50\%$ acid solution to produce $12$ liters of a $35\%$ acid solution. How many liters of each solution are used?

Let $x$ = liters of $20\%$ solution. Then $(12 - x)$ = liters of $50\%$ solution.

$$0.20x + 0.50(12 - x) = 0.35(12)$$
$$0.20x + 6 - 0.50x = 4.2$$
$$-0.30x = -1.8$$
$$x = 6$$

**Answer:** $6$ liters of $20\%$ solution and $6$ liters of $50\%$ solution

---

**Problem 4:** A tank contains $100$ liters of a $10\%$ salt solution. Water is added to dilute the solution to $8\%$. How much water was added?

The amount of salt stays the same: $0.10 \times 100 = 10$ liters.

Let $x$ = liters of water added.

$$\frac{10}{100 + x} = 0.08$$
$$10 = 0.08(100 + x)$$
$$10 = 8 + 0.08x$$
$$2 = 0.08x$$
$$x = 25$$

**Answer:** $25$ liters of water

---

## 7.5 — The Factor of Change Approach

### 7.5.1 — Concept

When a problem describes how certain quantities change by specific percentages or factors, and asks how a related quantity changes, you can use the **factor of change** method.

**Steps:**
1. Start with the formula relating the quantities
2. Eliminate constants
3. Replace each variable with its factor of change
4. Solve for the unknown factor of change
5. Convert the factor to a percent change

---

### 7.5.2 — Kinetic Energy Example

**Example:** The kinetic energy of an object is $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$. If the mass is decreased by $20\%$ and the speed is increased by $20\%$, by what percent does the kinetic energy change?

$$KE \sim mv^2$$

Factor of change:

## 7.6 — Advanced Percent Applications

### 7.6.1 — Percentile

A **percentile** indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations fall. If you score in the $85$th percentile, you scored higher than $85\%$ of test-takers.

**Note:** Percentile is NOT the same as percent correct. A percentile rank is a comparison to other test-takers, not a measure of how many questions you answered correctly.

---

### 7.6.2 — Simple Interest

$$I = Prt$$

where $I$ = interest, $P$ = principal, $r$ = annual interest rate (as a decimal), $t$ = time in years.

**Example:** $\$5000$ is invested at $4\%$ simple annual interest for $3$ years. What is the total amount?

$$I = 5000 \times 0.04 \times 3 = \$600$$
$$\text{Total} = 5000 + 600 = \$5600$$

---

### 7.6.3 — Compound Interest

$$A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$$

where $A$ = final amount, $P$ = principal, $r$ = annual rate, $n$ = number of times compounded per year, $t$ = time in years.

**Example:** $\$1000$ is invested at $5\%$ annual interest compounded quarterly for $2$ years.

$$A = 1000\left(1 + \frac{0.05}{4}\right)^{4 \times 2} = 1000(1.0125)^8 \approx 1000 \times 1.1045 = \$1104.49$$

---

### 7.6.4 — Markup and Markdown

**Markup:** The increase from cost to selling price.

$$\text{Markup \%} = \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Cost}} \times 100$$

**Markdown (Discount):** The decrease from original price to sale price.

$$\text{Markdown \%} = \frac{\text{Original Price} - \text{Sale Price}}{\text{Original Price}} \times 100$$

**Example:** A store buys a shirt for $\$20$ and sells it for $\$35$. What is the markup percent?

$$\text{Markup \%} = \frac{35 - 20}{20} \times 100 = 75\%$$

**Example:** The same shirt goes on sale for $\$28$. What is the markdown percent from the original selling price?

$$\text{Markdown \%} = \frac{35 - 28}{35} \times 100 = 20\%$$

---

### 7.6.5 — Practice Problems: Advanced Percents

**Problem 1:** A store marks up all items by $40\%$. During a sale, everything is marked down by $25\%$. What is the net percent profit or loss on an item that cost the store $\$100$?

Cost: $\$100$
After markup: $\$100 \times 1.40 = \$140$
After markdown: $\$140 \times 0.75 = \$105$

Net profit: $\$5$ on $\$100$ cost = $5\%$ profit

**Answer:** $5\%$ profit

---

**Problem 2:** $\$2000$ is invested at $6\%$ annual interest compounded semi-annually. What is the value after $1$ year?

$$A = 2000\left(1 + \frac{0.06}{2}\right)^2 = 2000(1.03)^2 = 2000 \times 1.0609 = \$2121.80$$

**Answer:** $\$2121.80$

---

**Problem 3:** A product's price is first increased by $20\%$, then decreased by $20\%$. What is the net percent change?

$$\text{Factor} = 1.20 \times 0.80 = 0.96$$

Net change: $4\%$ decrease

**Answer:** $4\%$ decrease

# Chapter 8: Triangles, Trigonometry, and Geometry Essentials

## 1. Fundamental Properties of Triangles

### 1.1 Angle Relationships
The most fundamental property of any triangle is that the sum of its three internal angles is always 180°.
$$\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ$$

**Exterior Angle Theorem**: The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent (remote) interior angles.
$$\text{Exterior Angle} = \text{Sum of Remote Interior Angles}$$

### 1.2 The Triangle Inequality Theorem
The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides:
$$a + b > c$$
$$a + c > b$$
$$b + c > a$$
Furthermore, the length of any side must be less than the semi-perimeter and greater than the positive difference of the other two sides.

### 1.3 Side-Angue Relationships
In any triangle:
*   The **longest side** is opposite the **largest angle**.
*   The **shortest side** is opposite the **smallest angle**.
*   If two angles are congruent, the sides opposite them are congruent (Isosceles Triangle Theorem).

---

## 2. Special Triangles

### 2.1 Isosceles Triangles
A triangle with at least two congruent sides.
*   **Legs**: The congruent sides.
*   **Base**: The non-congruent side.
*   **Base Angles**: The angles opposite the legs; they are always congruent.
*   **Vertex Angle**: The angle formed by the two legs.

### 2.2 Equilateral Triangles
A triangle where all three sides are congruent.
*   All three angles are congruent and measure **60°**.
*   It is a special case of an isosceles triangle.

### 2.3 Right Triangles
A triangle containing exactly one 90° angle.
*   The side opposite the right angle is the **hypotenuse** (always the longest side).
*   The other two sides are called **legs**.
*   The two acute angles are **complementary** (sum to 90°).

#### The Pythagorean Theorem
In any right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$:
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

**Common Pythagorean Triples** (Memorize these!):
*   **3, 4, 5** (and multiples like 6, 8, 10)
*   **5, 12, 13** (and multiples like 10, 24, 26)
*   **8, 15, 17**
*   **7, 24, 25**

#### Special Right Triangles
**1. The 45°-45°-90° Triangle (Isosceles Right Triangle)**
The ratio of the sides is $x : x : x\sqrt{2}$.
*   If a leg is $7$, the hypotenuse is $7\sqrt{2}$.
*   If the hypotenuse is $10$, each leg is $\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = 5\sqrt{2}$.

**2. The 30°-60°-90° Triangle**
The ratio of the sides (opposite 30° : opposite 60° : hypotenuse) is $x : x\sqrt{3} : 2x$.
*   If the short leg (opposite 30°) is $5$, the long leg is $5\sqrt{3}$ and the hypotenuse is $10$.
*   If the hypotenuse is $14$, the short leg is $7$ and the long leg is $7\sqrt{3}$.

---

## 3. Similar Triangles

Two triangles are **similar** if their corresponding angles are congruent and their corresponding sides are proportional.

### 3.1 Methods for Proving Similarity
1.  **AA (Angle-Angle)**: If two angles of one triangle are congruent to two angles of another triangle, the triangles are similar. (Since the sum of angles is 180°, the third angle must also be congruent).
2.  **SSS (Side-Side-Side)**: If the corresponding sides of two triangles are proportional, the triangles are similar.
3.  **SAS (Side-Angle-Side)**: If two sides are proportional and the included angle is congruent, the triangles are similar.

### 3.2 Solving for Missing Sides
If $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$, then:
$$\frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{AC}{DF}$$
Set up a proportion using the known sides and solve for the unknown variable using cross-multiplication.

---

## 4. Trigonometry (Right Triangle Trig)

Trigonometry is the study of the ratios of the sides of a right triangle as a function of one of the acute angles.

### 4.1 The Core Ratios (SOH CAH TOA)
Let $\theta$ be an acute angle in a right triangle.
*   **Sine ($\sin$)**: Opposite / Hypotenuse
*   **Cosine ($\cos$)**: Adjacent / Hypotenuse
*   **Tangent ($\tan$)**: Opposite / Adjacent

### 4.2 Reciprocal Functions
*   **Cosecant ($\csc \theta$)**: $1 / \sin \theta$ = Hypotenuse / Opposite
*   **Secant ($\sec \theta$)**: $1 / \cos \theta$ = Hypotenuse / Adjacent
*   **Cotangent ($\cot \theta$)**: $1 / \tan \theta$ = Adjacent / Opposite

### 4.3 Cofunction Identities
Sine and cosine are "cofunctions," meaning they produce equivalent ratios when evaluated at complementary angles.
$$\sin(x) = \cos(90^\circ - x)$$
$$\cos(x) = \sin(90^\circ - x)$$

### 4.4 Using Trig to Find Missing Sides/Anges
**To find a side**: Label the sides relative to the given angle. Choose the trig function that relates the given side and the unknown side. Set up the equation and solve.
**To find an angle**: Use the inverse trig functions ($\sin^{-1}, \cos^{-1}, \tan^{-1}$) on your calculator.

---

## 5. Area of Triangles

### 5.1 Standard Formula
$$A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$$
*Note: The height must be perpendicular to the base.*

### 5.2 Area Using Trigonometry
If you know two sides and the included angle (SAS):
$$A = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin(C)$$
Where $a$ and $b$ are two sides and $C$ is the angle between them.

### 5.3 Heron's Formula
Used when you know all three sides ($a, b, c$) but not the height.
1.  Calculate the **semi-perimeter** ($s$): $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$
2.  Calculate Area ($A$): $A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$

---

## 6. Lines and Angles

### 6.1 Angle Pairs
*   **Complementary Angles**: Two angles whose sum is 90°.
*   **Supplementary Angles**: Two angles whose sum is 180°.
*   **Vertical Angles**: Angles opposite each other when two lines intersect. They are always **congruent**.
*   **Linear Pair**: Two adjacent angles whose non-common sides form a straight line. They are always **supplementary**.

### 6.2 Parallel Lines and Transversals
When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal (a third line):
*   **Corresponding Angles**: Congruent (e.g., top-left to top-left).
*   **Alternate Interior Angles**: Congruent (inside the parallels, on opposite sides of the transversal).
*   **Alternate Exterior Angles**: Congruent (outside the parallels, on opposite sides of the transversal).
*   **Same-Side Interior Angles**: Supplementary (inside the parallels, on the same side of the transversal).

---

## 7. Polygons

### 7.1 Sum of Interior Angles
For any $n$-sided polygon:
$$\text{Sum} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ$$
*   Triangle (3): $180^\circ$
*   Quadrilateral (4): $360^\circ$
*   Pentagon (5): $540^\circ$
*   Hexagon (6): $720^\circ$

### 7.2 Sum of Exterior Angles
For **any** convex polygon, the sum of the exterior angles (one at each vertex) is always **360°**.

---

## 8. Practice Problems

**Problem 1 (Triangle Inequality)**
A triangle has sides of length 9 and 6. What are all possible integer values for the perimeter of the triangle?

**Problem 2 (Special Right Triangles)**
In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is 20. What is the area of the triangle?

**Problem 3 (Similar Triangles)**
$\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$. If $AB = 8$, $BC = 12$, and $DE = 6$, what is the length of $EF$?

**Problem 4 (Trigonometry)**

**Problem 5 (Angles)**
Two angles are supplementary. One angle is 25% larger than the other. Find the measure of both angles.

---

## 9. Solutions

**Solution 1:**
Let the third side be $x$.
Using the Triangle Inequality:
1.  $9 + 6 > x \Rightarrow x < 15$
2.  $9 + x > 6 \Rightarrow x > -3$ (always true for positive lengths)
3.  $6 + x > 9 \Rightarrow x > 3$
So, $3 < x < 15$. Since $x$ must be an integer, $x$ can be $4, 5, 6, \dots, 14$.
Perimeter $P = 9 + 6 + x = 15 + x$.
Minimum $P = 15 + 4 = 19$.
Maximum $P = 15 + 14 = 29$.
Possible integer perimeters: $19, 20, 21, \dots, 29$.

**Solution 2:**
In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of sides is $x : x\sqrt{3} : 2x$.
Hypotenuse $= 2x = 20 \Rightarrow x = 10$.
The legs are $10$ (short leg) and $10\sqrt{3}$ (long leg).
Area $= \frac{1}{2} \times \text{leg}_1 \times \text{leg}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10\sqrt{3} = 50\sqrt{3}$.

**Solution 3:**
Set up the proportion based on corresponding sides:
$\frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF}$
$\frac{8}{6} = \frac{12}{EF}$
$8 \times EF = 72$
$EF = 9$.

**Solution 4:**
$\sin(P) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{QR}{PR} = \frac{3}{5}$.
We are given $PQ = 9$. Note that $PQ$ is the side adjacent to angle $P$.
We can find $PR$ (hypotenuse) using $\cos(P)$ or Pythagorean theorem logic.
If $\sin(P) = 3/5$, the sides of the reference triangle are 3, 4, 5.
So $\cos(P) = 4/5$.
$\cos(P) = \frac{PQ}{PR} = \frac{9}{PR} = \frac{4}{5}$.
$4 \times PR = 45 \Rightarrow PR = 11.25$.
Now use $\sin(P)$ to find $QR$:
$\frac{QR}{11.25} = \frac{3}{5} \Rightarrow 5 \times QR = 33.75 \Rightarrow QR = 6.75$.

**Solution 5:**
Let the smaller angle be $x$. The larger angle is $1.25x$.
$x + 1.25x = 180$
$2.25x = 180$
$x = 80^\circ$.
The angles are $80^\circ$ and $100^\circ$.

---

## PART I: GRAMMAR FUNDAMENTALS

---

### Section 1: The Three Useless Clauses

A complete sentence requires only two elements: a **subject** and a **verb**. Everything else—no matter how long or elaborate—can be stripped away, and the sentence will still stand. The three "useless" clauses are structures that, while adding detail, color, and nuance, are grammatically expendable. Learning to identify them is essential for SAT/ACT grammar questions because the tests frequently ask you to determine whether a sentence remains complete after their removal.

---

#### 1.1 Relative Clauses

A **relative clause** is a dependent clause that begins with a **relative pronoun** and modifies a noun in the main clause. The five relative pronouns are:

- **who** — used for people (subject)
- **whom** — used for people (object)
- **whose** — used for possession (people or things)
- **which** — used for things
- **that** — used for people or things (restrictive clauses only)

**Key Rule:** A relative clause is NEVER set off by commas when it is **restrictive** (i.e., essential to the meaning of the noun it modifies). It IS set off by commas when it is **nonrestrictive** (i.e., adds extra, nonessential information).

**Examples:**

- *Restrictive (no commas):* "The student **who scored a 1600 on the SAT** is my friend."
  - Here, "who scored a 1600 on the SAT" identifies WHICH student. Remove it, and you lose critical information about which student is being discussed.

- *Nonrestrictive (commas required):* "My sister, **who lives in Chicago**, is visiting next week."
  - Here, "who lives in Chicago" adds extra information about the sister, but we already know which sister is meant. The clause can be removed without destroying the core meaning.

**SAT/ACT Trap:** The tests often place a nonrestrictive relative clause next to a noun and omit the commas, creating a punctuation error. Always ask: "Is this clause essential to identifying the noun, or is it just adding bonus information?"

**Crossing Out Exercise:**

> "The novel, which was written by Toni Morrison, explores themes of identity and belonging."

Cross out the relative clause: "The novel explores themes of identity and belonging." ✓ Still a complete sentence.

> "The car that was parked in the driveway belongs to my neighbor."

Cross out the relative clause: "The car belongs to my neighbor." ✓ Still a complete sentence (though less specific).

---

#### 1.2 Comma Clauses (Three Types)

"Comma clause" is an umbrella term for three types of dependent clauses that are set off by commas and can be removed without destroying the sentence's grammatical completeness.

**Type 1: Introductory Comma Clause (ICC)**

An introductory comma clause begins a sentence and is followed by a comma. It typically starts with a **subordinating conjunction**, a **preposition**, or an **-ing adverb**.

Common subordinating conjunctions: *although, because, while, when, if, since, after, before, unless, whereas, even though, as, once, until*

**Structure:** ICC + comma + MAIN SENTENCE

**Examples:**

- "**Although the rain was heavy**, the game continued."
- "**After finishing her homework**, Maria went to the library."
- "**Running late for class**, Tom forgot his textbook."

**Critical Rule — Subject Modification:** When an introductory clause contains an action (especially one starting with an -ing word), the subject of the main clause MUST be the person or thing that can logically perform that action. This is the **introductory comma clause modification rule**.

**Correct:** "**Driving to school**, **Sarah** noticed a rainbow." (Sarah was driving.)

**Incorrect (Dangling Modifier):** "**Driving to school**, **the rainbow** was beautiful." (The rainbow was not driving.)

**How to fix a dangling modifier:** Change the subject of the main clause to the person/thing that can logically perform the action in the ICC.

**Corrected:** "**Driving to school**, **Sarah** saw a beautiful rainbow."

**SAT/ACT Trap:** The tests love dangling modifiers. If an introductory clause begins with an -ing word or a subordinating conjunction implying an action, check whether the subject immediately following the comma can logically perform that action.

---

**Type 2: Ending Comma Clause (ECC)**

An ending comma clause comes at the end of a sentence and is usually preceded by a comma. It often begins with an **-ing adverb** or a **prepositional phrase** that defines or clarifies something in the main clause.

**Examples:**

- "The students studied all night, **hoping to ace the exam**."
- "She walked out of the building, **surprised by the results**."
- "The team celebrated their victory, **exhausted but elated**."

**Note:** Ending comma clauses often function as adverbial or adjectival phrases that describe the manner, result, or state of the subject.

---

**Type 3: Middle Comma Clause (MCC) / Appositive / Nonessential Clause**

A middle comma clause interrupts the main sentence and is set off by commas on BOTH sides. It is also called an **appositive** or **nonessential clause**. Removing it should leave a grammatically complete sentence.

**Structure:** SUBJECT + comma + MCC + comma + VERB (and the rest of the sentence)

**Examples:**

- "My brother, **a talented musician**, plays three instruments."
- "The Eiffel Tower, **which is located in Paris**, attracts millions of visitors."
- "Dr. Johnson, **the principal of the school**, announced the new policy."

**SAT/ACT Trap:** The tests will sometimes place a middle comma clause between the subject and the verb without proper commas, or with only one comma. Both commas are required for a nonessential MCC.

**Tricky Case — MCC inside an ICC:**

> "**During the hailstorm**, the first ever recorded in the city, **Maria** hit her head."

Here, "the first ever recorded in the city" is an MCC embedded within the introductory clause. The subject "Maria" still correctly modifies the action of the main clause ("hit her head").

---

#### 1.3 Prepositional Phrases

A **prepositional phrase** begins with a **preposition** and ends with a **noun** (called the object of the preposition). It functions as an adjective or adverb, modifying a noun or verb.

Common prepositions: *in, on, at, by, for, with, from, to, of, about, between, through, during, before, after, under, over, above, below, near, beside, among, within, without, along, across, behind, beyond*

**Examples:**

- "The book **on the table** is mine." (modifies "book")
- "She walked **through the park**." (modified "walked")
- "**After the game**, we went **to the restaurant**." (modifies "went")

**Key Point:** Prepositional phrases are NEVER essential to a sentence's grammatical completeness. You can cross them all out and still have a subject and verb remaining.

**Crossing Out Exercise:**

> "The students in the classroom with the new desks from the fundraiser after the assembly were excited."

Cross out all prepositional phrases: "The students were excited." ✓ Complete sentence.

### Section 2: Subject-Verb Agreement (SVA)

Subject-verb agreement is one of the most frequently tested grammar concepts on the SAT and ACT. The rule is simple in principle but complex in application.

**Core Rule:** A singular subject takes a singular verb. A plural subject takes a plural verb.

In English, **singular verbs** typically end in **-s** (e.g., *runs, plays, is, has, does*), while **plural verbs** do NOT end in -s (e.g., *run, play, are, have, do*). This is the opposite of nouns, where -s usually indicates plural.

---

#### 2.1 Finding the Subject

The subject can NEVER be found within:
- A **relative clause**
- A **prepositional phrase**
- A **comma clause** (introductory, middle, or ending)

**Process for Identifying the Subject:**

1. Cross out all relative clauses.
2. Cross out all prepositional phrases.
3. Cross out all comma clauses.
4. What remains is the core sentence: subject + verb.
5. Determine if the subject is singular or plural.
6. Ensure the verb agrees.

**Example:**

> "Each of the students in the advanced classes **has** completed the assignment."

- Cross out: "of the students" (prepositional phrase), "in the advanced classes" (prepositional phrase)
- Remaining: "Each has completed the assignment."
- "Each" is singular → verb must be singular: "has" ✓

---

#### 2.2 Tricky Subject-Verb Agreement Cases

**Case 1: Indefinite Pronouns**

Some indefinite pronouns are ALWAYS singular:
- *each, every, everyone, everybody, anyone, anybody, someone, somebody, no one, nobody, either, neither, one, another*

Some are ALWAYS plural:
- *both, few, many, several, others*

Some can be singular or plural depending on context:
- *all, any, more, most, none, some* (look at the object of the preposition that follows)

**Examples:**

- "Everyone **is** here." (singular)
- "Both **are** ready." (plural)
- "Some of the cake **is** gone." (cake = singular → "is")
- "Some of the cookies **are** gone." (cookies = plural → "are")

**Case 2: Compound Subjects**

Subjects joined by "and" are usually plural:
- "The cat and the dog **are** playing."

BUT: When "and" joins two words that refer to the same person/thing, the subject is singular:
- "The founder and CEO **is** speaking." (one person who is both)

Subjects joined by "or" or "nor" agree with the subject CLOSEST to the verb:
- "Neither the teacher nor the students **were** present." (students = plural → "were")
- "Neither the students nor the teacher **was** present." (teacher = singular → "was")

**Case 3: Collective Nouns**

Words like *team, family, group, committee, class, audience, government* are usually treated as SINGULAR in American English when the group acts as a unit:
- "The team **is** winning."

They are PLURAL when the members act individually:
- "The team **are** arguing among themselves." (British English; less common on SAT/ACT)

**Case 4: Words That Look Plural but Are Singular**

- *news, mathematics, physics, economics, politics* (when referring to the subject/field)
- *measles, mumps*
- *the United States*

**Examples:**

- "The news **is** shocking."
- "Mathematics **is** my favorite subject."

**Case 5: "There" Sentences**

When a sentence begins with "there," the subject comes AFTER the verb:
- "There **are** three books on the table." (books = plural)
- "There **is** a book on the table." (book = singular)

**Case 6: Inverted Sentences**

In questions or sentences beginning with prepositional phrases, the subject may not come first:
- "**In the box** were three kittens." (kittens = plural → "were")

---

#### 2.3 Subject-Verb Agreement with Relative Pronouns

When a relative pronoun (who, which, that) is the subject of a relative clause, the verb in that clause agrees with the ANTECEDENT (the noun the pronoun refers to):

- "The students who **are** studying will pass." (students = plural → "are")
- "The student who **is** studying will pass." (student = singular → "is")

---

### Section 3: Verb Tenses

Verb tense indicates WHEN an action occurs. The SAT/ACT tests your ability to maintain **tense consistency** within a passage and to choose the correct tense based on context clues.

---

#### 3.1 The Six Main Tenses

| Tense | Structure | Example | Signal Words |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Simple Past | verb + -ed (or irregular) | She **walked** | yesterday, last year, in 1990, ago |
| Simple Present | verb / verb + -s | She **walks** | always, usually, every day, now |
| Simple Future | will + verb | She **will walk** | tomorrow, next year, soon |
| Present Perfect | has/have + past participle | She **has walked** | since, for, already, yet, ever, never, recently |
| Past Perfect | had + past participle | She **had walked** | before, by the time, already (in past context) |
| Future Perfect | will have + past participle | She **will have walked** | by, by the time (future reference) |

---

#### 3.2 Key Tense Rules for SAT/ACT

**Rule 1: Use the present perfect (has/have + past participle) with "since" and "for" when the action continues into the present.**

- "She **has lived** here **since** 2010." (She still lives here.)
- "They **have worked** at the company **for** five years." (They still work there.)

**Rule 2: Use the past perfect (had + past participle) to show that one past action happened BEFORE another past action.**

- "By the time I arrived, the movie **had already started**."
- "She **had finished** her homework before she went out."

**Rule 3: Use the simple past for completed actions at a specific time in the past.**

- "Columbus **sailed** to America in 1492."
- "She **graduated** last year."

**Rule 4: Use the simple present for general truths, habits, and ongoing states.**

- "Water **boils** at 100°C."
- "The Earth **revolves** around the Sun."

**Rule 5: Maintain tense consistency. Do not shift tenses without a logical reason.**

- Inconsistent: "She **walked** to the store and **buys** milk."
- Consistent: "She **walked** to the store and **bought** milk."

---

#### 3.3 Helping Verbs and Tense Identification

The SAT/ACT often tests your ability to identify the correct helping verb to pair with a main verb. Here is a breakdown:

**Simple Present:** No helping verb (just the base form, or base + -s for third person singular)
- "She **plays** tennis."

**Simple Past:** No helping verb (just the past form)
- "She **played** tennis."

**Future:** "will" + base verb
- "She **will play** tennis."

**Present Perfect:** "has" (singular) or "have" (plural) + past participle
- "She **has played** tennis." / "They **have played** tennis."

**Past Perfect:** "had" + past participle
- "She **had played** tennis."

**Conditional (would):** "would" + base verb
- "She **would play** tennis if she had time."

**Conditional Perfect (would have):** "would have" + past participle
- "She **would have played** tennis if she had known."

---

#### 3.4 Tense Consistency in Passages

When editing a passage, always check for **unnecessary tense shifts**. If the passage is written in the past tense, all verbs describing events in that time frame should be in the past tense—unless there is a clear reason to shift (e.g., a general truth or a more recent event).

**Example of an error:**

> "The researcher conducted the experiment and **records** the results. She then **analyzed** the data and **publishes** her findings."

**Corrected:**

> "The researcher conducted the experiment and **recorded** the results. She then **analyzed** the data and **published** her findings."

---

### Section 4: Punctuation Mastery

Punctuation is heavily tested on the SAT/ACT. The key is understanding the FUNCTION of each punctuation mark and the RULES governing its use.

---

#### 4.1 Commas

The comma is the most frequently tested punctuation mark. Here are ALL the rules:

**Rule 1: Use commas to separate items in a list of three or more.**

- "I bought apples, oranges, and bananas."
- The Oxford comma (before "and") is preferred on the SAT/ACT.

**Rule 2: Use a comma before a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS) that joins two independent clauses.**

FANBOYS = For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So

- "She studied hard, **but** she still failed the test."
- "I wanted to go, **so** I got ready quickly."

**Rule 3: Use a comma after an introductory clause or phrase.**

- "**After the rain stopped**, we went outside."
- "**Running late**, she skipped breakfast."

**Rule 4: Use commas to set off nonessential (nonrestrictive) elements.**

- "My brother, **who is a doctor**, lives in Boston."
- "The book, **published in 1925**, is a classic."

**Rule 5: Do NOT use a comma to separate a subject from its verb.**

- Incorrect: "The tall man with the hat, was waiting."
- Correct: "The tall man with the hat was waiting."

**Rule 6: Do NOT use a comma between two independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction. This is a COMMA SPLICE.**

- Incorrect: "She studied hard, she passed the test."
- Correct: "She studied hard; she passed the test." OR "She studied hard, and she passed the test."

**Rule 7: Use commas after introductory words like "however," "therefore," "moreover," "furthermore," "nevertheless" when they begin a sentence.**

- "**However**, the results were inconclusive."

**Rule 8: Use commas to separate coordinate adjectives (adjectives that independently modify the same noun and could be connected by "and").**

- "She is a **talented, dedicated** teacher." (You could say "talented and dedicated.")
- BUT: "She wore a **bright red** dress." (Not "bright and red"—these are cumulative adjectives, so no comma.)

---

#### 4.2 Semicolons

**Rule 1: Use a semicolon to join two closely related independent clauses WITHOUT a coordinating conjunction.**

- "She studied hard; she passed the test."
- "The experiment was successful; the results were published."

**Rule 2: Use a semicolon before transitional expressions (however, therefore, moreover, furthermore, consequently, nevertheless, for example, in fact, etc.) that connect two independent clauses.**

- "She studied hard; **therefore**, she passed the test."
- "The data was inconclusive; **however**, the team continued their research."

**Rule 3: Use semicolons to separate items in a list when the items themselves contain commas.**

- "The conference was attended by Dr. Smith, the keynote speaker; Ms. Jones, the organizer; and Mr. Lee, the sponsor."

---

#### 4.3 Colons

**Rule 1: A colon must be preceded by a COMPLETE INDEPENDENT CLAUSE.**

- Correct: "She brought three items: a pen, a notebook, and a calculator."
- Incorrect: "She brought: a pen, a notebook, and a calculator." (Not a complete clause before the colon.)

**Rule 2: Use a colon to introduce a list, an explanation, an elaboration, or a quotation.**

- "The recipe requires the following ingredients: flour, sugar, eggs, and butter."
- "He had one goal: to win the championship."

**Rule 3: Do NOT use a colon after a verb or preposition that directly introduces the list.**

- Incorrect: "The ingredients are: flour, sugar, and eggs."
- Correct: "The ingredients are flour, sugar, and eggs."

---

#### 4.4 Dashes

**Rule 1: Use a dash (em dash) to set off a middle comma clause for emphasis or dramatic effect.**

- "The winner—**a complete novice**—shocked everyone."
- "She finally found what she was looking for—**her lost ring**."

**Rule 2: Use a dash to add information at the end of a sentence, especially when the information is surprising or emphatic.**

- "He studied for eight hours straight—**and still failed**."
- "There was only one possible explanation—**sabotage**."

**Rule 3: Dashes can replace commas, colons, or parentheses when you want more emphasis.**

- Instead of commas: "My best friend—the one I've known since kindergarten—is moving away."
- Instead of a colon: "She had one dream—to become a doctor."

---

#### 4.5 Apostrophes

**Rule 1: Use an apostrophe + s ('s) to show possession for singular nouns.**

- "The **student's** book" (one student)
- "**James's** car" (singular noun ending in s—both "James's" and "James'" are acceptable, but the SAT/ACT typically uses "James's")

**Rule 2: Use an apostrophe after the s (s') to show possession for plural nouns ending in s.**

- "The **students'** books" (multiple students)
- "The **teachers'** lounge"

**Rule 3: Use 's for irregular plural nouns that don't end in s.**

- "The **children's** toys"
- "The **people's** choice"

**Rule 4: Do NOT use an apostrophe with possessive pronouns.**

- **its** (possessive) vs. **it's** (contraction of "it is")
- **whose** (possessive) vs. **who's** (contraction of "who is")
- **theirs, ours, yours, hers, his** (NO apostrophes)

**Rule 5: Use apostrophes for contractions.**

- **it's** = it is
- **don't** = do not
- **they're** = they are
- **who's** = who is

**SAT/ACT Favorite:** The tests LOVE to confuse "its" vs. "it's," "their" vs. "they're" vs. "there," and "whose" vs. "who's."

---

#### 4.6 Common Punctuation Errors Tested

**Error 1: Comma Splice**
- Incorrect: "She was tired, she went to bed early."
- Correct: "She was tired; she went to bed early." OR "She was tired, so she went to bed early."

**Error 2: Run-on Sentence**
- Incorrect: "She was tired she went to bed early."
- Correct: "She was tired. She went to bed early." OR "She was tired; she went to bed early."

**Error 3: Fused Sentence with "however"**
- Incorrect: "She was tired however she stayed up."
- Correct: "She was tired; however, she stayed up." OR "She was tired. However, she stayed up."

**Error 4: Missing comma after introductory element**
- Incorrect: "After eating the dog went for a walk."
- Correct: "After eating, the dog went for a walk."

**Error 5: Unnecessary comma before a list introduced by a verb**
- Incorrect: "She enjoys: reading, writing, and hiking."
- Correct: "She enjoys reading, writing, and hiking."

## PART II: TRANSITIONS

---

### Section 5: Understanding Transition Relationships

Transitions are words or phrases that show the logical relationship between ideas. On the SAT/ACT, you will be asked to choose the transition that best completes a sentence or connects two sentences. The key is to identify the **relationship** between the ideas BEFORE looking at the answer choices.

---

#### 5.1 The Major Transition Categories

**Category 1: Addition / Support / Emphasis**
These transitions add information or reinforce a point.

| Transition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Furthermore | "The plan is effective. Furthermore, it is cost-efficient." |
| Moreover | "She is intelligent. Moreover, she is hardworking." |
| Additionally | "The car is fast. Additionally, it is fuel-efficient." |
| In addition | "He speaks French. In addition, he speaks Spanish." |
| Also | "She is a talented musician. She is also a skilled painter." |
| Indeed | "The results were impressive. Indeed, they exceeded all expectations." |
| In fact | "He seems quiet. In fact, he is quite outgoing." |
| As a matter of fact | "I thought it was expensive. As a matter of fact, it was quite affordable." |

**Category 2: Contrast / Opposition / Concession**
These transitions show that the second idea contrasts with or opposes the first.

| Transition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| However | "She studied hard. However, she failed." |
| Nevertheless | "The odds were against him. Nevertheless, he succeeded." |
| Nonetheless | "It was raining. Nonetheless, we went hiking." |
| On the other hand | "City life is exciting. On the other hand, it can be stressful." |
| Conversely | "Hot air rises. Conversely, cold air sinks." |
| In contrast | "The first experiment succeeded. In contrast, the second failed." |
| Although | "Although she was tired, she kept working." |
| Even though | "Even though it was cold, she went outside." |
| Whereas | "He prefers tea, whereas she prefers coffee." |
| While | "While I agree with your point, I disagree with your conclusion." |
| Despite / In spite of | "Despite the rain, the event was well-attended." |

**Category 3: Cause and Effect / Result**
These transitions show that one thing causes or results from another.

| Transition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Therefore | "She studied hard. Therefore, she passed." |
| Consequently | "He missed the deadline. Consequently, he lost the contract." |
| As a result | "The road was icy. As a result, many accidents occurred." |
| Thus | "The data was corrupted. Thus, the experiment had to be repeated." |
| Hence | "The budget was cut. Hence, the project was delayed." |
| Accordingly | "The weather was severe. Accordingly, the flight was canceled." |
| So | "It was raining, so we stayed inside." |
| For this reason | "She was allergic to nuts. For this reason, she avoided the dessert." |

**Category 4: Example / Illustration**
These transitions introduce specific examples or evidence.

| Transition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| For example | "Many fruits are rich in vitamin C. For example, oranges and strawberries." |
| For instance | "Some animals hibernate. For instance, bears sleep through winter." |
| Specifically | "She loves outdoor sports. Specifically, she enjoys rock climbing." |
| In particular | "The course covers many topics. In particular, it focuses on genetics." |
| To illustrate | "The economy is struggling. To illustrate, unemployment has risen sharply." |
| Such as | "Tropical fruits, such as mangoes and papayas, are rich in vitamins." |

**Category 5: Sequence / Order / Time**
These transitions show the order of events or steps.

| Transition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| First, Second, Third | "First, gather the materials. Second, mix the ingredients." |
| Next | "She finished her homework. Next, she practiced piano." |
| Then | "He woke up. Then, he brushed his teeth." |
| Subsequently | "She graduated. Subsequently, she found a job." |
| Meanwhile | "He cooked dinner. Meanwhile, she set the table." |
| Finally | "After months of work, she finally completed the project." |
| Before | "Before you leave, turn off the lights." |
| After | "After the meeting, we went to lunch." |
| Previously | "Previously, the company had operated at a loss." |
| Eventually | "She practiced every day. Eventually, she mastered the piece." |

**Category 6: Conclusion / Summary**
These transitions signal a conclusion or summary.

| Transition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| In conclusion | "In conclusion, the evidence supports the theory." |
| To sum up | "To sum up, exercise is essential for good health." |
| In summary | "In summary, the project was a success." |
| Overall | "Overall, the new policy has been beneficial." |
| In short | "In short, we need to work harder." |
| Ultimately | "Ultimately, the decision is yours." |
| All in all | "All in all, it was a great experience." |

**Category 7: Similarity / Comparison**
These transitions show that two ideas are similar.

| Transition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Similarly | "She excels in math. Similarly, she is strong in science." |
| Likewise | "He was praised for his work. Likewise, her efforts were recognized." |
| In the same way | "She helps her colleagues. In the same way, she mentors new employees." |
| By the same token | "We should respect our elders. By the same token, we should listen to experts." |
| Equally | "Both candidates were qualified. Equally, both had strong leadership skills." |

**Category 8: Condition**
These transitions introduce a condition.

| Transition | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| If | "If it rains, the game will be canceled." |
| Unless | "Unless you study, you will not pass." |
| Provided that | "You can go, provided that you finish your homework." |
| As long as | "As long as you try your best, I will be proud." |

---

#### 5.2 How to Approach Transition Questions

**Step 1:** Read the sentence containing the transition AND the sentences before and after it.

**Step 2:** Determine the logical relationship between the ideas:
- Does the second sentence ADD to the first? → Addition
- Does the second sentence CONTRADICT the first? → Contrast
- Does the second sentence RESULT from the first? → Cause/Effect
- Does the second sentence GIVE AN EXAMPLE? → Example
- Does the second sentence SHOW ORDER? → Sequence
- Does the second sentence SUMMARIZE? → Conclusion

**Step 3:** Eliminate answer choices that don't match the relationship.

**Step 4:** If two choices seem correct, look at the PUNCTIATION and GRAMMAR of the transition:
- "However" needs a semicolon before it and a comma after it when joining two independent clauses.
- "Therefore" follows the same pattern.
- "For example" can begin a sentence or be inserted after a comma.

**Example:**

> "The new policy was designed to reduce costs. __________, it actually increased expenses."

**Analysis:** The second sentence CONTRASTS with what was expected. We need a contrast transition.

**Answer choices:**
A) Therefore (cause/effect) ✗
B) However (contrast) ✓
C) For example (example) ✗
D) Furthermore (addition) ✗

**Answer: B) However**

---

#### 5.3 Transitions Within a Single Sentence

Some transition questions ask you to complete a single sentence with a transition word. The same logic applies—identify the relationship between the two parts of the sentence.

**Example:**

> "__________ the experiment was well-designed, the results were inconclusive."

The first clause acknowledges something positive, but the second clause presents a contrasting outcome. We need a concessive transition.

**Answer:** "Although the experiment was well-designed, the results were inconclusive."

---

#### 5.4 Transitions Between Paragraphs

Sometimes the SAT/ACT asks you to choose the best transition sentence to connect two paragraphs. In these cases:

1. Read the LAST sentence of the first paragraph.
2. Read the FIRST sentence of the second paragraph.
3. Determine the relationship between the two paragraphs.
4. Choose the option that best bridges the ideas.

---

## PART III: READING COMPREHENSION STRATEGIES

---

### Section 6: Active Reading and Annotation

The SAT and ACT Reading sections test your ability to understand, analyze, and interpret passages. Success requires more than just reading—it requires **active engagement** with the text.

---

#### 6.1 The Annotation Method

**Step 1: Read the passage once, focusing on understanding.**

Don't try to memorize every detail. Instead, focus on:
- What is the MAIN IDEA of each paragraph?
- What is the AUTHOR'S PURPOSE? (To inform, persuade, argue, describe, explain?)
- What is the AUTHOR'S TONE? (Neutral, critical, enthusiastic, skeptical, sympathetic?)

**Step 2: Circle or highlight transitional words and phrases.**

Transitions are the skeleton of a passage's argument. By marking them, you can quickly see how ideas connect:
- "However" → the author is about to contrast
- "For example" → evidence is coming
- "Therefore" → a conclusion is being drawn
- "Furthermore" → additional support is being added

**Step 3: Write a brief margin note for each paragraph.**

In 3-5 words, summarize the main point of each paragraph. This creates a "map" of the passage that you can refer back to when answering questions.

**Example:**

> Paragraph 1: "History of steam cars"
> Paragraph 2: "Why steam cars failed"
> Paragraph 3: "Modern revival efforts"
> Paragraph 4: "Environmental benefits"

**Step 4: Identify the author's main claim or purpose.**

After reading, ask yourself:
- What is the author trying to convince me of?
- What is the central argument or point?
- Is the author objective or biased?

---

#### 6.2 Passage Types and Strategies

**Type 1: Literary Narrative (SAT/ACT)**

These passages are excerpts from novels, short stories, or memoirs. Focus on:
- **Character motivations:** Why does a character do what they do?
- **Tone and mood:** What feeling does the passage convey?
- **Foreshadowing:** What future events are hinted at?
- **Symbolism:** What do objects, settings, or actions represent?

**Strategy:** Pay attention to what characters say, think, and do. The correct answer will always be supported by specific details in the passage—never by outside knowledge or assumptions.

---

**Type 2: Humanities (SAT)**

These passages are about art, literature, philosophy, or cultural topics. They often feature:
- A discussion of an artist, writer, or thinker's work
- An analysis of a cultural phenomenon
- A debate about interpretation or meaning

**Strategy:** Identify the author's perspective on the subject. Is the author praising, critiquing, or analyzing? Look for evaluative language (adjectives, adverbs) that reveal the author's attitude.

---

**Type 3: Science Passages (SAT/ACT)**

These passages present scientific information, research findings, or debates about scientific topics. Focus on:
- **The main finding or hypothesis:** What did the research discover or propose?
- **The evidence:** What data or observations support the claim?
- **The methodology:** How was the research conducted?
- **Conflicting viewpoints:** Are there competing theories or interpretations?

**Strategy:** Don't get bogged down in technical details. Focus on the BIG PICTURE: What is the main idea? What evidence supports it? What are the implications?

---

**Type 4: History/Social Science (SAT)**

These passages are about historical events, social issues, or political ideas. They often feature:
- A primary source (speech, letter, historical document)
- An analysis of a historical event or movement
- A debate about policy or social change

**Strategy:** Identify the author's argument and the evidence used to support it. Pay attention to the historical context and the author's purpose in writing.

---

#### 6.3 Question Types and How to Answer Them

**Type 1: Main Idea / Primary Purpose**

These questions ask: "What is the passage mainly about?" or "The primary purpose of the passage is to..."

**Strategy:**
- Look at your margin notes for each paragraph.
- Identify the common thread that runs through all paragraphs.
- Eliminate answers that are too narrow (focusing on one detail) or too broad (going beyond the passage's scope).

**Wrong answer traps:**
- Too specific: focuses on one paragraph only
- Too general: goes beyond what the passage actually discusses
- Distortion: twists the author's meaning slightly
- Opposite: states the opposite of what the author argues

---

**Type 2: Detail / Specific Information**

These questions ask about a specific fact, detail, or piece of information in the passage.

**Strategy:**
- Use your margin notes to locate the relevant paragraph.
- Go back to the passage and read the specific lines carefully.
- The correct answer will be a PARAPHRASE of what the passage says—not an exact quote.

**Wrong answer traps:**
- Uses words from the passage but changes the meaning
- States something that is TRUE but not mentioned in the passage
- Confuses two similar details from different parts of the passage

---

**Type 3: Inference**

These questions ask you to draw a conclusion based on information in the passage. The answer is NOT directly stated but can be logically inferred.

**Strategy:**
- Find the specific lines that relate to the question.
- Ask: "What MUST be true based on this information?"
- The correct answer will be strongly supported by the text, even if not explicitly stated.

**Wrong answer traps:**
- Too extreme: uses words like "always," "never," "only," "all"
- Not supported: goes beyond what the passage implies
- Contradicted: directly contradicts information in the passage

---

**Type 4: Vocabulary in Context**

These questions ask what a word or phrase means AS USED IN THE PASSAGE.

**Strategy:**
- Go back to the passage and read the sentence containing the word.
- Try replacing the word with each answer choice.
- Choose the option that best fits the CONTEXT—not necessarily the most common definition.

**Example:**

> "The scientist's theory was **novel** and challenged existing assumptions."

What does "novel" mean in this context?
A) Fictional
B) New and original ✓
C) Lengthy
D) Controversial

Even though "novel" can mean a work of fiction, the context ("challenged existing assumptions") tells us it means "new and original."

---

**Type 5: Function / Rhetorical Purpose**

These questions ask WHY the author includes a particular detail, example, or paragraph.

**Strategy:**
- Look at the context: What comes before and after the referenced material?
- Ask: "What role does this play in the author's argument?"
- Common functions: to provide evidence, to introduce a counterargument, to illustrate a point, to transition between ideas, to emphasize a claim.

---

**Type 6: Evidence-Based (Command of Evidence)**

These questions ask: "Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?" OR "Which lines best support the answer?"

**Strategy:**
- Go back to the lines referenced in each answer choice.
- Determine which set of lines MOST DIRECTLY supports the answer to the previous question.
- The correct evidence will be specific and directly relevant—not just vaguely related.

---

**Type 7: Paired Passages**

The SAT often presents two shorter passages on the same topic. Questions may ask about each passage individually or about the relationship between them.

**Strategy:**
- Read Passage 1 and answer questions about it.
- Read Passage 2 and answer questions about it.
- For relationship questions, ask: "Do the authors AGREE or DISAGREE?" and "What is each author's main point?"

---

#### 6.4 The Process of Elimination

On the SAT/ACT, it's often easier to eliminate wrong answers than to identify the correct one immediately. Here's how:

**Eliminate answers that:**
1. **Are too extreme** — Words like "always," "never," "all," "none," "only" are rarely correct.
2. **Are too vague** — If an answer could apply to ANY passage, it's probably wrong.
3. **Contradict the passage** — Even partially.
4. **Are not supported by evidence** — If you can't point to specific lines that support it, eliminate it.
5. **Distort the author's meaning** — Close but slightly off.
6. **Are true but irrelevant** — The statement may be true in real life, but if it's not discussed in the passage, it's wrong.

---

#### 6.5 Time Management Strategies

**For the SAT Reading Section (65 minutes, 5 passages):**
- Spend approximately 13 minutes per passage (including reading and answering questions).
- Read the passage in 3-4 minutes.

### Section 7: Rhetorical Synthesis

The SAT Digital format includes a question type called **Rhetorical Synthesis**, which presents you with bullet-pointed notes about a topic and asks you to combine the information into a sentence that meets a specific rhetorical goal.

---

#### 7.1 How to Approach Rhetorical Synthesis Questions

**Step 1: Read the question prompt carefully.**

Identify the CLAIM you need to make and the EVIDENCE you need to use.

**Step 2: Review the bullet points.**

Each bullet point contains a fact, detail, or piece of information. Determine which bullets are RELEVANT to the claim you need to make.

**Step 3: Synthesize the information.**

Combine the relevant bullet points into a single, clear sentence that:
- Makes the required claim
- Uses the required evidence
- Is grammatically correct
- Is concise (not wordy)

**Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices.**

Choose the option that best accomplishes the rhetorical goal stated in the prompt.

---

#### 7.2 Common Rhetorical Goals

- **Emphasize a contrast:** Use "however," "while," "in contrast"
- **Provide evidence:** Use "for example," "as shown by," "according to"
- **Draw a conclusion:** Use "therefore," "thus," "as a result"
- **Add information:** Use "additionally," "moreover," "furthermore"
- **Concede a point:** Use "although," "despite," "while"

---

### Section 8: Words in Context

The SAT frequently tests your ability to determine the meaning of a word based on how it's used in a passage. This is NOT about memorizing vocabulary (though that helps)—it's about using CONTEXT CLUES.

---

#### 8.1 Types of Context Clues

**Type 1: Definition Clue**
The passage directly defines the word.
- "The **ephemeral** nature of the flowers—lasting only a day—made them precious."

**Type 2: Synonym Clue**
A similar word appears nearby.
- "She was **elated**, **overjoyed** at the news."

**Type 3: Antonym Clue**
An opposite word or contrast signal appears nearby.
- "Unlike his **gregarious** brother, who loved parties, he was quiet and reserved."

**Type 4: Example Clue**
Examples help clarify the meaning.
- "The museum displayed **artifacts**—pottery, tools, and jewelry—from ancient civilizations."

**Type 5: Inference Clue**
The overall context suggests the meaning.
- "After months of **drought**, the rains finally came, and the parched earth drank deeply."

---

#### 8.2 Strategy for Words in Context Questions

1. **Cover the answer choices** and read the sentence with the word.
2. **Predict** what the word means based on context.
3. **Uncover the choices** and find the one closest to your prediction.
4. **Plug it back in** to verify it makes sense.

## PART IV: PRACTICE PROBLEMS WITH DETAILED EXPLANATIONS

---

### Grammar Practice

**Problem 1:**

> "The committee, composed of twelve members from various departments, (has/have) reached a decision."

**Answer:** has

**Explanation:** "Committee" is a collective noun treated as singular in American English. The prepositional phrase "of twelve members from various departments" does NOT change the subject. The subject is "committee" (singular), so the verb must be "has."

---

**Problem 2:**

> "Neither the students nor the teacher (was/were) aware of the schedule change."

**Answer:** was

**Explanation:** With "neither...nor," the verb agrees with the subject CLOSEST to it. "Teacher" is singular, so the verb is "was."

---

**Problem 3:**

> "The book that I borrowed from the library, which was recommended by my professor, (is/are) overdue."

**Answer:** is

**Explanation:** The subject is "book" (singular). The relative clauses "that I borrowed from the library" and "which was recommended by my professor" are both modifiers and do not affect subject-verb agreement. The verb must be "is."

---

**Problem 4:**

> "Running through the park at dawn, (the sunrise was/Sarah saw) breathtaking."

**Answer:** Sarah saw

**Explanation:** The introductory clause "Running through the park at dawn" contains an action. The subject of the main clause must be the person who was running. "The sunrise" cannot run, so the correct subject is "Sarah."

---

**Problem 5:**

> "The data in the report (shows/show) a significant increase in sales."

**Answer:** show

**Explanation:** "Data" is technically the plural of "datum." On the SAT/ACT, "data" is usually treated as plural. The prepositional phrase "in the report" does not affect the subject. Therefore, the verb should be "show."

---

### Punctuation Practice

**Problem 6:**

> "She wanted to go to the concert. However she couldn't get tickets."

Which is the best correction?

A) NO CHANGE
B) concert, however she
C) concert; however, she
D) concert, however, she

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** "However" is a conjunctive adverb joining two independent clauses. The correct punctuation is a semicolon before "however" and a comma after it.

---

**Problem 7:**

> "The three main causes of the war were: economic instability, political corruption, and social unrest."

Which correction should be made?

A) NO CHANGE
B) were economic
C) were; economic
D) were, economic

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** A colon should NOT be used after a verb ("were") that directly introduces a list. The correct version simply removes the colon: "The three main causes of the war were economic instability, political corruption, and social unrest."

---

**Problem 8:**

> "My sister a talented artist painted a beautiful mural."

Which correction should be made?

A) NO CHANGE
B) sister, a talented artist, painted
C) sister; a talented artist; painted
D) sister: a talented artist: painted

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** "A talented artist" is a nonessential appositive that renames "my sister." It must be set off by commas on BOTH sides.

---

### Transition Practice

**Problem 9:**

> "The new highway reduced commute times significantly. __________, it also led to increased air pollution in nearby neighborhoods."

A) Therefore
B) However
C) For example
D) Furthermore

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:** The second sentence ADDS another consequence of the new highway. It's not a contrast (B), a conclusion (A), or an example (C). "Furthermore" correctly signals an additional point.

---

**Problem 10:**

> "__________ the company's profits have increased, employee satisfaction has declined."

A) Because
B) Although
C) Therefore
D) Similarly

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The sentence presents a CONTRAST: profits up, satisfaction down. "Although" is the correct concessive transition to show this unexpected relationship.

---

**Problem 11:**

> "The experiment yielded unexpected results. __________, the researchers decided to revise their hypothesis."

A) However
B) For instance
C) Consequently
D) Meanwhile

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The unexpected results CAUSED the researchers to revise their hypothesis. This is a cause-and-effect relationship. "Consequently" (meaning "as a result") is the correct transition.

---

### Reading Comprehension Practice

**Passage Excerpt:**

> "The concept of the 'zone of proximal development' was introduced by psychologist Lev Vygotsky to describe the gap between what a learner can do without help and what they can achieve with guidance. A learner completes a task with the assistance of a more knowledgeable other, such as a teacher or peer; subsequently, the learner internalizes the skill and can perform the task independently."

**Question:** As used in the passage, "subsequently" most nearly means

A) However
B) Therefore
C) Afterward
D) Simultaneously

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The context shows a sequence: first the learner gets help, THEN they internalize the skill. "Subsequently" means "afterward" or "following that." It indicates a temporal sequence, not a contrast (A), a conclusion (B), or simultaneity (D).

---

**Question:** The primary purpose of the passage is to

A) argue that teachers are essential for learning
B) explain a psychological concept
C) compare different learning theories
D) criticize traditional education methods

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The passage is explanatory in nature. It introduces and defines Vygotsky's "zone of proximal development." It does not argue (A), compare theories (C), or criticize (D). The author's purpose is purely informational.

## PART VI: FINAL PRACTICE TEST

---

### Section A: Grammar (10 Questions)

**Directions:** Each sentence contains an error in grammar, usage, or mechanics. Choose the answer that corrects the error. If there is no error, choose A (NO CHANGE).

**1.** The collection of rare manuscripts, including several from the 15th century, are on display at the museum.

A) NO CHANGE
B) is on display
C) were on display
D) have been on display

**Answer:** B — "Collection" is a singular collective noun. The prepositional phrase "of rare manuscripts" does not change the subject.

**2.** Each of the participants in the study were required to sign a consent form.

A) NO CHANGE
B) was required
C) are required
D) have been required

**Answer:** B — "Each" is always singular. The prepositional phrase "of the participants in the study" does not affect subject-verb agreement.

**3.** Walking through the ancient ruins, the history of the civilization came alive for the tourists.

A) NO CHANGE
B) the tourists felt the history of the civilization come alive
C) the history was coming alive for tourists
D) there was a sense of history coming alive

**Answer:** B — The introductory clause "Walking through the ancient ruins" requires the subject to be the people who were walking. Only option B provides a logical subject ("the tourists").

**4.** The reason she failed the test is because she didn't study.

A) NO CHANGE
B) is that she didn't study
C) is due to her not studying
D) is on account of her not studying

**Answer:** B — "The reason...is because" is redundant. The correct construction is "The reason...is that..."

**5.** Neither the manager nor the employees was willing to compromise.

A) NO CHANGE
B) were willing
C) has been willing
D) is willing

**Answer:** B — With "neither...nor," the verb agrees with the closest subject. "Employees" is plural, so the verb should be "were."

**6.** The team, along with their coaches, are traveling to the championship.

A) NO CHANGE
B) is traveling
C) were traveling
D) have been traveling

**Answer:** B — "Along with" does not create a compound noun. The subject is "team" (singular collective noun), so the verb should be "is."

**7.** Having been notified of the changes, the report was revised by the committee.

A) NO CHANGE
B) the committee revised the report
C) there was a revision of the report by the committee
D) the report underwent revision

**Answer:** B — The introductory clause "Having been notified of the changes" requires the subject to be the people who were notified. Only option B provides a logical subject ("the committee").

**8.** The number of students who participate in extracurricular activities have increased.

A) NO CHANGE
B) has increased
C) are increasing
D) were increasing

**Answer:** B — "The number of" is always singular. Compare with "A number of" (plural).

**9.** She is one of those students who always completes their homework on time.

A) NO CHANGE
B) complete their homework on time
C) completes her homework on time
D) complete his or her homework on time

**Answer:** B — The relative clause "who always complete" modifies "students" (plural), so the verb should be "complete." The pronoun "their" also agrees with the plural antecedent.

**10.** Between you and I, the decision was unfair.

A) NO CHANGE
B) you and me
C) I and you
D) me and you

**Answer:** B — After the preposition "between," the pronouns must be in the objective case: "you and me."

---

### Section B: Punctuation (8 Questions)

**11.** The conference will feature speakers from three fields: medicine, engineering, and education.

A) NO CHANGE
B) fields, medicine,
C) fields; medicine,
D) fields medicine,

**Answer:** A — The colon correctly follows a complete sentence and introduces a list.

**12.** She was an excellent student, she graduated with honors.

A) NO CHANGE
B) student; she graduated
C) student she graduated
D) student, and she graduated

**Answer:** B — Two independent clauses cannot be joined by a comma alone (comma splice). A semicolon is correct here. Option D would also be grammatically correct with "and," but B is the best choice given the options.

**13.** The ingredients for the recipe include: flour, sugar, eggs, and butter.

A) NO CHANGE
B) include flour,
C) include; flour,
D) include: flour;

**Answer:** B — A colon should NOT be used after a verb that directly introduces a list. Remove the colon.

**14.** My uncle, a retired pilot has traveled to over fifty countries.

A) NO CHANGE
B) pilot, has traveled
C) pilot; has traveled
D) pilot has traveled

**Answer:** B — "A retired pilot" is a nonessential appositive that must be set off by commas on BOTH sides.

**15.** The project was challenging however, the team completed it on time.

A) NO CHANGE
B) challenging, however, the
C) challenging; however, the
D) challenging, however; the

**Answer:** C — "However" is a conjunctive adverb joining two independent clauses. The correct punctuation is a semicolon before and a comma after.

**16.** The company's CEO—a visionary leader with decades of experience announced the new strategy.

A) NO CHANGE
B) experience—announced
C) experience, announced
D) experience; announced

**Answer:** B — The appositive "a visionary leader with decades of experience" must be set off by dashes on BOTH sides (or commas on both sides). The closing dash is missing.

**17.** The childrens' toys were scattered across the room.

A) NO CHANGE
B) children's toys
C) childrens toys
D) childrens's toys

**Answer:** B — "Children" is an irregular plural (not ending in s), so the possessive is formed by adding 's: "children's."

**18.** Its unclear whether they're going to finish on time.

A) NO CHANGE
B) It's unclear whether they're
C) Its unclear whether their
D) It's unclear whether their

**Answer:** B — "Its" (possessive) should be "It's" (contraction of "it is"). "They're" (contraction of "they are") is correct because the sentence needs a subject and verb, not a possessive pronoun.

A) Therefore
B) Moreover
C) However
D) For example

**Answer:** C — The second sentence LIMITS or CONTRASTS with the implication of the first. The controlled conditions suggest reliability, but the author cautions that real-world application may differ.

**23.** She practiced the piano for six hours a day. __________, she won the national competition.

A) However
B) Meanwhile
C) Consequently
D) Although

**Answer:** C — The intense practice LED TO her winning. This is a cause-and-effect relationship.

**24.** The first theory suggests that the phenomenon is caused by temperature changes. __________ proposes that pressure variations are responsible.

A) The second theory
B) Similarly, the second theory
C) Therefore, the second theory
D) For example, the second theory

### Section D: Reading Comprehension (5 Questions)

**Passage:**

> The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 18th century, fundamentally transformed the nature of work. Prior to industrialization, most production occurred in homes or small workshops, with skilled artisans crafting goods by hand. The introduction of mechanized production in factories shifted labor from rural areas to urban centers, creating a new class of industrial workers. While this transition generated unprecedented economic growth, it also brought significant social challenges, including poor working conditions, child labor, and urban overcrowding. Reform movements eventually emerged to address these issues, leading to labor laws and regulations that shaped modern employment practices.

**25.** The primary purpose of the passage is to

A) argue that the Industrial Revolution was harmful to society
B) describe the transformation of work during the Industrial Revolution
C) compare pre-industrial and post-industrial working conditions
D) explain the causes of the Industrial Revolution

**Answer:** B — The passage describes how the Industrial Revolution changed the nature of work, covering both the shift to mechanized production and its social consequences. It does not primarily argue (A), compare (C), or explain causes (D).

**26.** As used in the passage, "unprecedented" most nearly means

A) unexpected
B) unmatched in scale
C) unwelcome
D) uncontrolled

**Answer:** B — The context describes "unprecedented economic growth"—growth that had never been seen before. "Unmatched in scale" best captures this meaning.

**27.** According to the passage, which of the following was a consequence of industrialization?

A) A decrease in urban population
B) The elimination of skilled artisan work
C) The emergence of reform movements
D) A decline in economic growth

**Answer:** C — The passage states that "Reform movements eventually emerged to address these issues." The other options are contradicted by the passage.

**28.** The passage suggests that the shift to factory production

A) was universally welcomed by workers
B) occurred gradually over several centuries
C) created both economic benefits and social problems
D) primarily affected agricultural workers

**Answer:** C — The passage explicitly states that the transition "generated unprecedented economic growth" but "also brought significant social challenges." This dual impact is the central theme.

**29.** Which of the following best describes the author's tone in the passage?

A) Nostalgic
B) Critical
C) Objective
D) Enthusiastic

**Answer:** C — The author presents information in a balanced, factual manner, noting both the benefits and challenges of industrialization without expressing a strong personal opinion.

## SUMMARY OF KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Grammar:** Find the true subject by eliminating prepositional phrases, relative clauses, and comma clauses. Ensure the verb agrees in number. Watch for dangling modifiers after introductory clauses.

2. **Punctuation:** Master the comma rules (especially the comma splice and nonessential elements). Know when to use semicolons (between independent clauses), colons (after complete sentences, before lists/explanations), and dashes (for emphasis). Never use apostrophes with possessive pronouns.

3. **Transitions:** Always identify the logical relationship between ideas BEFORE looking at answer choices. Eliminate choices that don't match the relationship.

4. **Reading Comprehension:** Annotate passages actively. Use margin notes. Always find textual evidence. Eliminate wrong answers using the "too extreme," "not supported," and "distortion" criteria. Manage your time carefully.

5. **Practice:** The key to ELA mastery is consistent, deliberate practice. Work through official SAT/ACT practice tests, review every mistake, and understand WHY the correct answer is correct—not just WHAT the correct answer is.

# Chapter 10: Full-Length Practice Problems, Timed Drills, and Answer Explanations With Common Mistake Analysis

---

## Introduction

This chapter is the capstone of everything you have learned so far. It brings together all the topics covered in the previous nine chapters—linear functions, quadratics, percents, rates, ratios, proportions, lines, angles, triangles, and trigonometry—into full-length, timed practice sets modeled after the actual SAT and ACT. Each problem is followed by a detailed, step-by-step answer explanation and a "Common Mistake Analysis" section that identifies the most frequent errors students make on that problem type, why those errors occur, and how to avoid them.

The chapter is organized into three full-length practice modules:

- **Module A: No-Calculator Section** (20 questions, 25 minutes)
- **Module B: Calculator Section** (38 questions, 55 minutes)
- **Module C: Timed Drills** (10 rapid-fire questions, 12 minutes)

After all three modules, you will find a comprehensive answer key with full explanations and common mistake analyses.

Before we begin, let us review the most critical formulas and concepts from each chapter that you must have memorized.

---

## Formula Review: The Complete Reference Sheet

### Linear Functions (Chapter 1)

**Slope Formula:**
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

**Slope-Intercept Form:**
$$y = mx + b$$
where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.

**Point-Slope Form:**
$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$

**Standard Form:**
$$Ax + By = C$$
where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integers and $A$ is non-negative.

**Parallel Lines:** Same slope ($m_1 = m_2$)

**Perpendicular Lines:** Negative reciprocal slopes ($m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1$)

**Midpoint Formula:**
$$\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)$$

**Distance Formula:**
$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

**Average Rate of Change (Slope over an interval):**
$$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}$$

---

### Quadratics (Chapters 2, 3, 4)

**Standard Form:**
$$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$

**Vertex Form:**
$$f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$$
where $(h, k)$ is the vertex.

**Intercept Form:**
$$f(x) = a(x - p)(x - q)$$
where $p$ and $q$ are the $x$-intercepts.

**Vertex (from Standard Form):**
$$h = -\frac{b}{2a}, \quad k = f\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right)$$

**Axis of Symmetry:**
$$x = -\frac{b}{2a}$$

**Quadratic Formula:**
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

**Discriminant:**
$$D = b^2 - 4ac$$
- $D > 0$: Two distinct real roots
- $D = 0$: One real root (a repeated root)
- $D < 0$: No real roots (two complex roots)

**Sum of Roots:**
$$p + q = -\frac{b}{a}$$

**Product of Roots:**
$$pq = \frac{c}{a}$$

**Completing the Square:**
$$ax^2 + bx + c = a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \left(c - \frac{b^2}{4a}\right)$$

---

### Percents (Chapter 5)

**Percent as a Factor:**
$$x\% = \frac{x}{100}$$

**Percent of a Whole:**
$$\text{Part} = \left(\frac{\text{Percent}}{100}\right) \times \text{Whole}$$

**Percent Change:**
$$\text{Percent Change} = \frac{\text{New} - \text{Old}}{\text{Old}} \times 100\%$$

**Percent Increase Factor:**
$$\text{New} = \text{Old} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Percent Increase}}{100}\right)$$

**Percent Decrease Factor:**
$$\text{New} = \text{Old} \times \left(1 - \frac{\text{Percent Decrease}}{100}\right)$$

**Successive Percent Changes:**
If a quantity is increased by $a\%$ and then decreased by $b\%$:
$$\text{Final} = \text{Original} \times \left(1 + \frac{a}{100}\right)\left(1 - \frac{b}{100}\right)$$

**Mixture Problems:**
$$C_1 V_1 + C_2 V_2 = C_{\text{final}}(V_1 + V_2)$$
where $C$ represents concentration and $V$ represents volume.

---

### Rates, Ratios, and Proportions (Chapter 6)

**Ratio Representation:**
If the ratio of $a$ to $b$ is $m:n$, then $a = mk$ and $b = nk$ for some positive constant $k$.

**Proportion:**
$$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \implies ad = bc$$

**Rate Formula:**
$$\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Quantity}}{\text{Consumption}}$$

**Average Speed:**
$$\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}$$

**Note:** Average speed is NOT the average of the speeds unless the time intervals are equal.

**Work Rate:**
If Person A can complete a job in $a$ hours and Person B in $b$ hours, together:
$$\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{T} \implies T = \frac{ab}{a + b}$$

**Factor of Change:**
If a quantity changes by a factor of $r$, and a related quantity is proportional to $n$ powers of the first, then the related quantity changes by a factor of $r^n$.

---

### Lines and Angles (Chapter 7)

**Angle Relationships:**
- **Complementary Angles:** Sum to $90°$
- **Supplementary Angles:** Sum to $180°$
- **Vertical Angles:** Congruent
- **Linear Pair:** Supplementary

**Triangle Angle Sum:**
$$\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180°$$

**Exterior Angle Theorem:**
$$\text{Exterior Angle} = \text{Sum of two remote interior angles}$$

**Sum of Exterior Angles of any Polygon:**
$$360°$$

**Sum of Interior Angles of an $n$-gon:**
$$180°(n - 2)$$

**Each Interior Angle of a Regular $n$-gon:**
$$\frac{180°(n - 2)}{n}$$

**Each Exterior Angle of a Regular $n$-gon:**
$$\frac{360°}{n}$$

**Triangle Inequality:**
The third side of a triangle must be greater than the positive difference of the other two sides and less than their sum:
$$|a - b| < c < a + b$$

**Side-Angle Relationship in a Triangle:**
The longest side is opposite the largest angle; the shortest side is opposite the smallest angle.

---

### Triangles: Right Triangles, Trigonometry, and Special Triangles (Chapters 8, 9)

**Pythagorean Theorem:**
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
where $c$ is the hypotenuse.

**Common Pythagorean Triples:**
- $3, 4, 5$ (and multiples: $6, 8, 10$; $9, 12, 15$; etc.)

**Special Right Triangles:**

**45°-45°-90° Triangle:**
The legs are congruent and the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$ times a leg.
$$\text{If leg} = s, \text{ then hypotenuse} = s\sqrt{2}$$

**30°-60°-90° Triangle:**
The side opposite 30° is the shortest leg. The side opposite 60° is $\sqrt{3}$ times the shortest leg. The hypotenuse is twice the shortest leg.
$$\text{If shortest leg} = s, \text{ then longer leg} = s\sqrt{3}, \text{ hypotenuse} = 2s$$

**Trigonometric Ratios (SOH-CAH-TOA):**
$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$

$$\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{adjacent}}$$
$$\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{opposite}}$$

**Cofunction Identities:**
$$\sin(\theta) = \cos(90° - \theta)$$
$$\cos(\theta) = \sin(90° - \theta)$$

**Area of a Triangle:**
$$A = \frac{1}{2}bh$$
$$A = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin(C) \quad \text{(two sides and included angle)}$$

$$s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}$$
$$A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$$

**Similar Triangles:**
- **AA Similarity:** Two angles of one triangle congruent to two angles of another.
- **SSS Similarity:** All three corresponding sides proportional.
- **SAS Similarity:** Two sides proportional and the included angle congruent.

If $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle XYZ$ with scale factor $k$:
$$\frac{AB}{XY} = \frac{BC}{YZ} = \frac{AC}{XZ} = k$$
$$\frac{\text{Area of } \triangle ABC}{\text{Area of } \triangle XYZ} = k^2$$

# ANSWER KEY AND EXPLANATIONS

---

## Module A: No-Calculator Section — Answers and Explanations

---

### Question 1

**Answer: A) 36**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

We are given $3x + 5 = 23$ and asked to find $6x + 10$.

Notice that $6x + 10 = 2(3x + 5)$. This is the key insight—we do not need to solve for $x$ individually.

$$6x + 10 = 2(3x + 5) = 2(23) = 46$$

Wait—let me recheck. $3x + 5 = 23$, so $3x = 18$, meaning $x = 6$. Then $6x + 10 = 6(6) + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46$.

**The answer is B) 46.**

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students often solve for $x$ first ($x = 6$), then substitute into $6x + 10$ to get $36 + 10 = 46$. This works, but some students forget to add the 10 and choose A) 36.
- **Mistake:** Some students see $6x + 10 = 2(3x + 5)$ and compute $2 \times 23 = 46$ correctly, but then second-guess themselves.
- **Prevention:** Always double-check by substituting your value of $x$ back into the original equation to verify.

---

### Question 2

**Answer: D) 20**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

The ratio of boys to girls is 3:5. This means:
- Number of boys = $3k$
- Number of girls = $5k$
- Total = $3k + 5k = 8k$

Since the total is 32 students:
$$8k = 32 \implies k = 4$$

Number of girls = $5k = 5(4) = 20$.

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes compute $3k = 12$ (the number of boys) and select A) 12, misreading the question.
- **Mistake:** Some students set up the proportion $\frac{3}{5} = \frac{x}{32}$ and solve incorrectly.
- **Prevention:** Always identify what the question is asking for before selecting your answer. Circle "how many girls" in the question.

---

### Question 3

**Answer: B) 45**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

The car travels at 60 miles per hour. We need the distance in 45 minutes.

Convert 45 minutes to hours: $45 \text{ minutes} = \frac{45}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ hour}$.

$$\text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ miles}$$

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes multiply $60 \times 45 = 2700$ without converting minutes to hours.
- **Mistake:** Some students convert incorrectly, using $\frac{45}{100}$ instead of $\frac{45}{60}$.
- **Prevention:** Always check units. Speed is in miles per hour, so time must be in hours.

---

### Question 4

**Answer: B) 15**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

Given $f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1$, find $f(-2)$:

$$f(-2) = 2(-2)^2 - 3(-2) + 1$$
$$= 2(4) + 6 + 1$$
$$= 8 + 6 + 1 = 15$$

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes compute $(-2)^2 = -4$ instead of $4$. Remember: a negative number squared is positive.
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes forget to apply the negative sign to the $-3(-2)$ term, computing it as $-6$ instead of $+6$.
- **Prevention:** Use parentheses when substituting: $2(-2)^2 - 3(-2) + 1$ is clearer than $2 \cdot -2^2 - 3 \cdot -2 + 1$.

---

### Question 5

**Answer: C) 115°**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, several angle relationships exist. $\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$ are same-side interior angles (also called consecutive interior angles), which are supplementary.

$$\angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180°$$
$$65° + \angle 2 = 180°$$
$$\angle 2 = 115°$$

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes think $\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$ are corresponding or alternate interior angles and conclude $\angle 2 = 65°$ (choice B).
- **Prevention:** Carefully identify the relationship between the two angles. Same-side interior angles are supplementary; alternate interior angles and corresponding angles are congruent.

---

### Question 6

**Answer: B) $71.08**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

Original price: $85.

**Step 1:** Apply the 20% discount.
$$\text{Discount} = 0.20 \times 85 = 17$$
$$\text{Sale price} = 85 - 17 = 68$$

**Step 2:** Apply 6% sales tax to the sale price.
$$\text{Tax} = 0.06 \times 68 = 4.08$$
$$\text{Final price} = 68 + 4.08 = 72.08$$

**The answer is C) $72.08.**

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes apply the tax to the original price ($85) instead of the discounted price ($68).
- **Mistake:** Some students add the discount and tax percentages (20% - 6% = 14% net discount) and compute $85 \times 0.86 = 73.10$, which is wrong because the tax applies to the reduced price, not the original.
- **Prevention:** Always work through discount problems step by step. The order matters: discount first, then tax.

---

### Question 7

**Answer: B) $-1$**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

Using the slope formula with $(-3, 7)$ and $(5, -1)$:

$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-1 - 7}{5 - (-3)} = \frac{-8}{8} = -1$$

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes reverse the order of subtraction in the numerator or denominator, getting $\frac{8}{-8} = -1$ (which happens to be correct here) or $\frac{8}{8} = 1$ (choice C).
- **Prevention:** Be consistent: always use $(x_2, y_2) - (x_1, y_1)$ in the same order for both numerator and denominator.

---

### Question 8

**Answer: B) 9**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

For a quadratic to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must equal zero.

$$x^2 - 6x + k = 0$$
$$a = 1, \quad b = -6, \quad c = k$$

$$D = b^2 - 4ac = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 36 - 4k$$

Set $D = 0$:
$$36 - 4k = 0 \implies k = 9$$

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes set $b^2 - 4ac > 0$ (for two solutions) instead of $= 0$ (for one solution).
- **Mistake:** Some students forget that $b = -6$, not $6$, though $(-6)^2 = 36 = 6^2$, so this doesn't affect the answer here. However, it would matter in other problems.
- **Prevention:** Memorize: one real solution means $D = 0$.

### Question 9

**Answer: B) $\frac{4}{5}$**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

First, find the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem:
$$AB = \sqrt{AC^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{36 + 64} = \sqrt{100} = 10$$

For $\angle A$:
- Opposite side = $BC = 8$
- Hypotenuse = $AB = 10$

$$\sin(A) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5}$$

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes use the adjacent side ($AC = 6$) instead of the opposite side, getting $\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$ (choice A). This is actually $\cos(A)$, not $\sin(A)$.
- **Prevention:** For $\sin(A)$, identify the side opposite angle $A$, not the side adjacent to angle $A$.

### Question 10

**Answer: B) 4**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

$$2^{x+1} = 32$$

Since $32 = 2^5$:
$$2^{x+1} = 2^5$$
$$x + 1 = 5$$
$$x = 4$$

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes think $32 = 2^6$ (confusing with 64) and get $x = 5$.
- **Prevention:** Know your powers of 2: $2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64$.

### Question 11

**Answer: C) 48**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

Let the width = $w$. Then the length = $3w$.

$$\text{Area} = l \times w = 3w \times w = 3w^2 = 108$$
$$w^2 = 36 \implies w = 6$$

So width = 6 and length = 18.

$$\text{Perimeter} = 2(l + w) = 2(18 + 6) = 2(24) = 48$$

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes find $w = 6$ and stop, thinking the question asks for the width.
- **Mistake:** Some students compute $3w^2 = 108$ and get $w^2 = 36$, then $w = 6$, but then compute the perimeter as $6 + 18 = 24$ (forgetting to multiply by 2).
- **Prevention:** Always reread the question after solving to make sure you're answering what was asked.

### Question 12

**Answer: C) 23**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

Let the three consecutive odd integers be $n$, $n+2$, and $n+4$.

$$n + (n+2) + (n+4) = 63$$
$$3n + 6 = 63$$
$$3n = 57$$
$$n = 19$$

The integers are 19, 21, and 23. The largest is 23.

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes use $n$, $n+1$, $n+2$ (consecutive integers, not consecutive odd integers), getting $3n + 3 = 63$, $n = 20$, and the "largest" as 22 (not an option, but the method is wrong).
- **Prevention:** Consecutive odd integers differ by 2, not 1.

### Question 13

**Answer: A) $\frac{5}{13}$**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

Given $\tan(\theta) = \frac{5}{12}$. In a right triangle, $\tan = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$.

So the side opposite $\theta$ is 5 and the side adjacent to $\theta$ is 12.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse is:
$$h = \sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = \sqrt{25 + 144} = \sqrt{169} = 13$$

Therefore:
$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{5}{13}$$

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes think $\sin(\theta) = \frac{5}{12}$ (confusing tangent with sine).
- **Mistake:** Some students use the adjacent side over the hypotenuse, getting $\frac{12}{13}$ (which is $\cos(\theta)$).
- **Prevention:** Draw the triangle. Label the sides based on the given trigonometric ratio, then compute the hypotenuse.

### Question 14

**Answer: C) 3**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

For $y = -2x^2 + 8x - 5$:
$$a = -2, \quad b = 8, \quad c = -5$$

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex:
$$h = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{8}{2(-2)} = -\frac{8}{-4} = 2$$

The $y$-coordinate:
$$k = f(2) = -2(2)^2 + 8(2) - 5 = -8 + 16 - 5 = 3$$

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes compute $h = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{8}{-4} = 2$ correctly, but then substitute incorrectly, e.g., $-2(2)^2 = -2(4) = -8$ but then compute $8(2) = 16$ and $-8 + 16 - 5 = 3$ correctly. A common error is $-2(2)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16$ (wrong order of operations).
- **Prevention:** Remember PEMDAS: exponents before multiplication. $-2(2)^2 = -2(4) = -8$, not $(-2 \cdot 2)^2 = 16$.

### Question 15

**Answer: C) 71.4%**

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

"Ashish is 250% older than Bob" means:
$$A = B + 2.5B = 3.5B$$

So $B = \frac{A}{3.5} = \frac{2A}{7}$.

"Bob is what percent younger than Ashish" means:
$$\text{Percent younger} = \frac{A - B}{A} \times 100\%$$

$$= \frac{A - \frac{2A}{7}}{A} \times 100\% = \frac{\frac{5A}{7}}{A} \times 100\% = \frac{5}{7} \times 100\% \approx 71.4\%$$

**Common Mistake Analysis:**
- **Mistake:** Students sometimes think "250% older" means $A = 2.5B$ instead of $A = B + 2.5B = 3.5B$. This is the most common error on this problem type.
- **Mistake:** Some students compute $\frac{B}{A} = \frac{2}{7} \approx 28.6\%$ and think this is the answer, but the question asks for "what percent YOUNG
